GTAG: Architecture and Design of Miniature Transmitter with Position Logging for Radio Telemetry,"The radio telemetry is a well-known technique used within zoological research to exploit the behaviour of animal species. A usage of GPS for a frequent and precise position recording gives interesting possibility for a further enhancement of this method. We present our proposal of an architecture and design concepts of telemetry transmitter with GPS module, called GTAG, that is suited for study of the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus). The model group we study set particular constrains, especially the weight limit (9 g) and prevention of any power resources recharging technique. We discuss the aspect of physical realization and the energy-consumption issues. We have developed a reference implementation that has been already deployed during telemetry sessions and we evaluate the experience and compare the estimated performance of our device to a real data.",1,1
From Radio Telemetry to Ultra-Low-Power Sensor Networks: Tracking Bats in the Wild,"Sensor networks have successfully been used for wildlife monitoring and tracking of different species. When it comes to small animals such as smaller birds, mammals, or even insects, the current approach is to use extremely lightweight RF tags located using radio telemetry. A new quantum leap in technology is needed to overcome this limitation and enable new ways to observe larger numbers of small animals. In an interdisciplinary team, we are working on the different aspects of such a new technology. In particular, we report on our findings on a sensor-network-based tracking solution for bats. Our system is based on integrated localization and wireless communication protocols for ultra-low-power systems. This requires coding techniques for improved reliability as well as ranging solutions for tracking hunting bats. We address the technological and methodical problems related to system design, software support, and protocol design. First field experiments have been conducted that showcase the capabilities of our system.",1,1
Foraging ecology of Leisler's bat (Nyctalus leisleri) at two sites in southern Britain,"Leisler's bat Nyctalus leisleri was studied at sites around Bristol and Kent in southern Britain. Its diet was studied by faecal analysis, and habitat use was monitored by radio-telemetry and time-expanding bat-detectors. The diet, which varied between the two sites and also with the season, consisted primarily of small Nematoceran Diptera plus smaller numbers of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera. Foraging ranges were relatively large - bats flew a mean maximum distance of 4.2 km from the roost. Minimum area convex polygons enclosed an average of 7.4 km(2), but were up to 18.4 km(2). Bats significantly preferred foraging in areas of woodland and along scrub-lined roads in Kent, but over pasture around Bristol. Urban and arable areas were avoided at both sites. Bat-detector transects showed a significant preference for bats to forage along woodland margins.",1,1
A comparison of the roosting behaviour of Gould's wattled bats Chalinolobus gouldii using bat boxes and tree hollows in suburban Melbourne,"Bats in suburban areas face a number of challenges adapting to what is a highly altered landscape. This is particularly true for species that prefer tree hollows for day roosts because the large, old trees that have developed suitable hollows are often removed from suburban areas. In suburban Melbourne,Victoria, Australia, during the last ten years, nest boxes have increasingly been used to provide additional roosts for bats in suburban parkland and remnant forest. However, little is known of the relative use of natural hollows and bat boxes, or whether the addition of new roosts may alter roosting behaviour. The types of resources available to bats may influence their roosting behaviour and have consequences for social interactions, predation risk and parasite loads. At Gresswell Nature Conservation Reserve, in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, there are both natural hollows and bat boxes available to a population of Gould's wattled bat Chalinolobus gouldii. This study investigated the relative use of the two roost types to determine if there were intra-specific differences in roost-use. We used radiotelemetry to locate the roost sites of six males and nine females from January until March 2007; all bats were initially caught while roosting in bat boxes. Roosts were subsequently found in 12 bat boxes and 10 tree hollows. Both sexes used tree hollows and bat boxes, and there was no apparent preference by either sex for either roost type. Individuals moved between the two roost types, indicating the boxes had been incorporated into the overall roosting resource available to the bats. Roost fidelity was variable, with some individuals regularly shifting roosts while others continued to use the same roost for up to 14 days. Bats using boxes shifted to new roosts significantly less often than when in hollows. The roost shifting behaviour of individuals using tree hollows in this study was very similar to that shown by C. gouldii using tree hollows in two previous studies in the rural landscape of northern Victoria.",1,1
On-board recordings reveal no jamming avoidance in wild bats,"Animals often deal with situations in which vast sensory input is received simultaneously. They therefore must possess sophisticated mechanisms to select important input and ignore the rest. In bat echolocation, this problem is at its extreme. Echolocating bats emit sound signals and analyse the returning echoes to sense their environment. Bats from the same species use signals with similar frequencies. Nearby bats therefore face the difficulty of distinguishing their own echoes from the signals of other bats, a problem often referred to as jamming. Because bats commonly fly in large groups, jamming might simultaneously occur from numerous directions and at many frequencies. Jamming is a special case of the general phenomenon of sensory segregation. Another well-known example is the human problem of following conversation within a crowd. In both situations, a flood of auditory incoming signals must be parsed into important versus irrelevant information. Here, we present a novel method, fitting wild bats with a miniature microphone, which allows studying jamming from the bat's 'point of view'. Previous studies suggested that bats deal with jamming by shifting their echolocation frequency. On-board recordings suggest otherwise. Bats shifted their frequencies, but they did so because they were responding to the conspecifics as though they were nearby objects rather than avoiding being jammed by them. We show how bats could use alternative measures to deal with jamming instead of shifting their frequency. Despite its intuitive appeal, a spectral jamming avoidance response might not be the prime mechanism to avoid sensory interference from conspecifics.",1,1
Habitat use of female gray bats assessed using aerial telemetry,"Gray bats (Myotis grisescens) were listed as endangered in 1976 because of population declines resulting from cave disturbance. The Gray Bat Recovery Plan identified the need to understand habitat use by this species. Yet, this need has never been adequately addressed, partly because gray bats are a highly mobile species with large home ranges, making ground-based tracking methods problematic. The objective of this study was to gather information on the foraging behavior of gray bats using aerial telemetry. We radio-tracked 112 reproductive female gray bats from 5 maternity colonies in Arkansas from a fixed-winged aircraft, in June-July of 2014 and 2015. We used fixed-kernel density to estimate the home range used by each colony and each individual. We performed a compositional analysis to determine land cover types selected by gray bats. Aerial telemetry was successful with 15 independent locations gathered for 42 individuals and an error of approximately 400m. Mean 95% individual home range was larger in 2014 (362.224.9 [SE] km(2)) than in 2015 (57.9 +/- 8.6km(2)). Female gray bats traveled and foraged over water proportionally more than expected based on availability. Our results show that aerial telemetry is suitable to track bat movements, and given its large home range size, management strategies for gray bats should extend beyond protecting roost sites to include waterways and riparian areas. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society. Our study has addressed the need to understand gray bat foraging ecology. Our results show that reproductive female gray bats have a larger home range than previously thought, they highly depend on water for foraging and traveling, and aerial telemetry may be the best option to track small, highly mobile nocturnal species over larger areas.",1,1
BATS: Adaptive Ultra Low Power Sensor Network for Animal Tracking,"In this paper, the BATS project is presented, which aims to track the behavior of bats via an ultra-low power wireless sensor network. An overview about the whole project and its parts like sensor node design, tracking grid and software infrastructure is given and the evaluation of the project is shown. The BATS project includes a lightweight sensor node that is attached to bats and combines multiple features. Communication among sensor nodes allows tracking of bat encounters. Flight trajectories of individual tagged bats can be recorded at high spatial and temporal resolution by a ground node grid. To increase the communication range, the BATS project implemented a long-range telemetry system to still receive sensor data outside the standard ground node network. The whole system is designed with the common goal of ultra-low energy consumption while still maintaining optimal measurement results. To this end, the system is designed in a flexible way and is able to adapt its functionality according to the current situation. In this way, it uses the energy available on the sensor node as efficient as possible.",1,1
Seasonal changes in the foraging behaviour of Leisler's bats (Nyctalus leisleri) in Ireland as revealed by radio-telemetry,"Leisler's bats Nyctalus leisleri, from two nursery colonies were radio-tracked from April to August in 2 years. They commuted directly to foraging sites up to 13.4 km away at speeds often exceeding 40 km h(-1) Except during lactation, individuals occasionally day-roosted away from the nursery in buildings or hollow trees. These were also sometimes used as night roosts, especially during rain, which also stimulated return to the nursery. On most nights the first flight lasted the longest. During preparturition, when distances from roost to foraging site were greatest, and time spent flying per night (t(F)) was least, there was often only one flight, with a second towards dawn on warmer nights, and occasionally a third. After parturition, in June, t(F) and the number of flights (N-F) increased up to weaning, corresponding to rising energy demands. But distances to foraging sites fell, rising only slightly in postlactation, presumably because insects, and thus feeding patches, were more abundant than in preparturition. N-F fell to preparturition levels after lactation. Exploratory behaviour by juveniles intensified with time - distances to feeding sites, t(F) and the total distance flown each night all increased; the distance flown each night was eventually greater than any recorded for adults. Roosting away from the nursery was also more common. Before dispersal, there were extended migrations by juveniles outside the summer range of the adults. Distances moved by two dispersed juveniles exceeded 34 km. Two-thirds of the recorded foraging time was over pasture or drainage canals. Foraging over other habitats, particularly lake and conifer forest, was greatest in preparturition. Other habitats foraged included lights, estuary, stream, beach and dunes.",1,1
Behavioral Response of Bats to Passive Integrated Transponder Tag Reader Arrays Placed at Cave Entrances,"An increasingly popular mark-recapture method to study the ecology of bats is the use of passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags. Deployment of PIT reader arrays at entrances to caves and mines can yield insight into bat behavior during swarming, winter activity, and emergence. This application has the potential to address questions about bat activity at cave and mine entrances in response to white-nose syndrome or bat seasonal movements; however, no studies have examined the response of bats to these arrays. We describe bat response to placement of PIT tag reader arrays using camcorders and supplemental infrared illuminators at three cave entrances near Bloomington, Indiana, during spring 2006. A random subset of 5-min periods was viewed and bat behavior was classified. Circling represented >70% of all behavior noted for two caves but only represented approximately 30% of behavior at the third cave. Proportions of observed activity that resulted in contacts or landings were consistently low across the three caves ((x) over bar = 1.34%; range 0.5-3.0%), with most contacts causing bats to simply change course and fly away. Based on our observations, positioning reader PIT tag reader arrays at cave entrances to passively recapture PIT tags does not limit bat movements. However, video monitoring during initial sampling efforts of future projects should be conducted to verify appropriate placement and configuration of PIT tag reader arrays. This research provides data illustrating the lack of significant impact in using PIT tag reader arrays at cave entrances, thereby opening up the potential use of this technology to address issues of bats ecology that cannot be obtained with other marking techniques.",0,0
Triaxial accelerometer sensor trials for bat swing interpretation in cricket,"Analysis of bat swing is important to the assessment and understanding of effective batting in cricket. The key features of a bat swing include the spatio-temporal position of the bat before contact with the ball and the bat velocity. The current methods of bat swing analysis such as video tracking and coach observation are labor intensive and expensive. This work examined the use of small, low-cost, three dimensional motion sensors as a replacement to existing methods. Using two bat-mounted accelerometer sensors, two experiments were conducted: a set of ball-free, straight drives by an amateur batter at nominal constant speed, and a set of straight drives at different speeds by the same batter accompanied by video tracking. In all cases the bat swing was in the x-z plane of the sensors placed on the reverse face of the bat. The bat face remains in the z direction. The objective was to minimize accelerations perpendicular to the swing plane. Data analysis revealed consistent acceleration profiles with minimal acceleration perpendicular to the plane of the swing (x-z plane). The time lag between the z acceleration peak and the x acceleration peak is related to the speed of the bat. The highest peak in x acceleration results from the higher centrifugal force with minimum radius of gyration while the bat was close to the batter (confirmed by the video footage). This is the dominant rotational component plus an additional gravitational force in the x direction when the bat is aligned to gravity. The sensor attached to the on-side edge of the bat showed higher peak magnitude in x acceleration compared to that from the off-side edge, which indicated variation between the two edges of the bat during swing. The tilted position of the stationary bat at the start of each swing was determined from the x and z axis profiles from minus one g and zero respectively. Different peak accelerations were evident for different swing intensities. This study indicated that the accelerometer sensors can provide reliable bat swing information.

Vampyrum spectrum (Phyllostomidae) movement and prey revealed by radio-telemetry and DNA metabarcoding,"The spectral bat (Vampyrum spectrum), the largest bat species in the Americas, is considered Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and is listed as a species of special concern or endangered in several countries throughout its range. Although the species is known as carnivorous, data on basic ecology, including habitat selection and primary diet items, are limited owing to its relative rarity and difficulty in capturing the species. Leveraging advances in DNA metabarcoding and using radio-telemetry, we present novel information on the diet and movement of V. spectrum based on locations of a radio-collared individual and fecal samples collected from its communal roost (three individuals) in the Lowland Dry Forest of southern Nicaragua. Using a non-invasive approach, we explored the diet of the species with genetic markers designed to capture a range of arthropods and vertebrate targets from fecal samples. We identified 27 species of vertebrate prey which included birds, rodents, and other bat species. Our evidence suggested that V. spectrum can forage on a variety of species, from those associated with mature forests to forest edge-dwellers. Characteristics of the roost and our telemetry data underscore the importance of large trees for roosting in mature forest patches for the species. These data can inform conservation efforts for preserving both the habitat and the prey items in remnants of mature forest required by Vampyrum spectrum to survive in landscape mosaics.",1,1
Habituation of common vampire bats to biologgers,"Rapid advancements in biologging technology have led to unprecedented insights into animal behaviour, but testing the effects of biologgers on tagged animals is necessary for both scientific and ethical reasons. Here, we measured how quickly 13 wild-caught and captively isolated common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) habituated to mock proximity sensors glued to their dorsal fur. To assess habituation, we scored video-recorded behaviours every minute from 18.00 to 06.00 for 3 days, then compared the rates of grooming directed to the sensor tag versus to their own body. During the first hour, the mean tag-grooming rate declined dramatically from 53% of sampled time (95% CI = 36-65%, n = 6) to 16% (8-24%, n = 9), and down to 4% by hour 5 (1-6%, n = 13), while grooming of the bat's own body did not decline. When tags are firmly attached, isolated individual vampire bats mostly habituate within an hour of tag attachment. In two cases, however, tags became loose before falling off causing the bats to dishabituate. For tags glued to fur, behavioural data are likely to be impacted immediately after the tag is attached and when it is loose before it falls off.",1,1
"Foraging habitat, home-range size and diet of a Mediterranean bat species, Savi's pipistrelle","The Mediterranean is considered one of the richest biodiversity regions in Europe, and bats contribute to this species richness. Within the last two decades, certain bat species traditionally considered as representatives of the Mediterranean have spread northwards and colonized areas outside this region. In our study, we focused on ecological requirements of one of these bat species, the Savi's pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii). We used radio-telemetry and diet analysis to describe habitat use, home-range size and diet composition of reproductive females of Savi's pipistrelle in the traditional core of its distribution range in the Mediterranean region. Our results indicate that Savi's pipistrelle is able to fly long distances and utilize a wide range of habitats within its home-range, with affinities for particular habitats depending on its reproductive status. In particular, pregnant females favoured rocky pastures and forest areas, followed by meadows and riparian habitat, whereas the affinity for riparian habitat increased in lactating females, followed closely by meadows, forest and rocky pastures. The larger affinity for riparian habitats during lactation might indicate its importance for successful rearing of young, which could be influenced in the future by increasing droughts and water shortage in the Mediterranean region. Nevertheless, based on our radio-telemetry and diet analysis the species shows a high degree of flexibility, as an opportunistic forager that flies across large areas on a nightly basis, which may be a good predisposition for colonizing new areas.",1,1
Wireless Sensor Platform for Detection of Vital Parameters of Bats,"In this paper an advanced sensor node for animal tracking is proposed, which includes an accelerometer, an air pressure sensor as well as an electrocardiography sensor. The system is designed for studying the physiology and behavior of bats by inferring activity, wing beat frequency as well as heart rate. This system offers outstanding functionality compared to other tracking nodes and is easily applicable thanks to its non-invasive design. Gluing the sensor to the bat's back keeps the impact on the animal at a minimum and retrieval of the animal to remove the tag is not required since the tag falls off after a few days.",1,1
On-board telemetry of emitted sounds from free-flying bats: compensation for velocity and distance stabilizes echo frequency and amplitude,"To understand complex sensory-motor behavior related to object perception by echolocating bats, precise measurements are needed for echoes that bats actually listen to during flight. Recordings of echolocation broadcasts were made from flying bats with a miniature light-weight microphone and radio transmitter (Telemike) set at the position of the bat's ears and carried during flights to a landing point on a wall. Telemike recordings confirm that flying horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum nippon) adjust the frequency of their sonar broadcasts to compensate for echo Doppler shifts. Returning constant frequency echoes were maintained at the bat's reference frequency +/- 83 Hz during flight, indicating that the bats compensated for frequency changes with an accuracy equivalent to that at rest. The flying bats simultaneously compensate for increases in echo amplitude as target range becomes shorter. Flying bats thus receive echoes with both stabilized frequencies and stabilized amplitudes. Although it is widely understood that Doppler-shift frequency compensation facilitates detection of fluttering insects, approaches to a landing do not involve fluttering objects. Combined frequency and amplitude compensation may instead be for optimization of successive frequency modulated echoes for target range estimation to control approach and landing.",1,1
Going bald - the hairy affair of timing in telemetry studies: moulting activity in European bat species,"Telemetry is a widely used method for radio-tracking bats. To minimize negative effects of attaching a tag, like bald spots during hibernation and nursery period, narrowing down the timing of the moult of bats is important. In this study, we investigated the moulting of 11 European bat species with a focus on Myotis daubentonii, Myotis myotis and Pipistrellus pipistrellus. Telemetry data were taken from a 20 years data base. For moulting activity bats were caught with mist nests during their activity period in 2019 and 2020. During data acquisition the condition of the hair was categorized using two different methods: visual hair growth and shed hair pulled off the bats' pelage. Both methods revealed the same results. In general, bats moulted once a year in mid-June (first moult: 17.06) until mid-August (last moult: 13.08), with a significant difference between adult males, reproductive females and nonreproductive females. Adult males (n = 197) and non-reproductive females (n = 60) moulted from mid-June (first moult: 17.06) to end of July (last moult: 27.07), while reproductive females (n = 216) moulted from beginning of July (first moult: 02.07) to mid-August (last moult: 17.08). This variance is probably caused by sex-specific energetic processes like pregnancy, lactation and spermatogenesis. When tagged before moulting season bats could regrow fur in the same year. As seen in recaptured bats (n = 31), tagged in or after this period bats stayed bald during hibernation and reproduction period until the following moulting season. Further studies are needed to specifically assess the impact of bald spots on hibernation and reproductive success. A preceding cost-benefit analysis of the expected knowledge gain versus the potential negative impact on individual and colony scale is recommended.",1,1
A 2.6-g sound and movement tag for studying the acoustic scene and kinematics of echolocating bats,"To study sensorimotor behaviour in wild animals, it is necessary to synchronously record the sensory inputs available to the animal, and its movements. To do this, we have developed a biologging device that can record the primary sensory information and the associated movements during foraging and navigating in echolocating bats. This 2.6-g tag records the sonar calls and echoes from an ultrasonic microphone, while simultaneously sampling fine-scale movement in three dimensions from wideband accelerometers and magnetometers. In this study, we tested the tag on an European noctula Nyctalus noctula during target approaches and on four big brown bats Eptesicus fuscus during prey interception in a flight room. We show that the tag records both the outgoing calls and echoes returning from objects at biologically relevant distances. Inertial sensor data enables the detection of behavioural events such as flying, turning, and resting. In addition, individual wing-beats can be tracked and synchronized to the bat's sound emissions to study the coordination of different motor events. By recording the primary acoustic flow of bats concomitant with associated behaviours on a very fine time-scale, this type of biologging method will foster a deeper understanding of how sensory inputs guide feeding behaviours in the wild.",1,1
BatRack: An open-source multi-sensor device for wildlife research,"Bats represent a highly diverse group of mammals and are essential for ecosystem functioning. However, knowledge about their behaviour, ecology and conservation status is limited. Direct observation of marked individuals (commonly applied to birds) is not possible for bats due to their small size, rapid movement and nocturnal lifestyle, while neither popular observation methods such as camera traps nor conventional tracking technologies sufficiently capture the behaviour of individuals. The combination and networking of different sensors in a single system can overcome these limitations, but this potential has been explored only to a limited extent. We present BatRack, a multi-sensor device that combines ultrasonic audio recordings, automatic radio telemetry and video camera recordings in a single modular unit. BatRack facilitates the individual or combined scheduling of sensors and includes a mutual triggering mode. It consists of off-the-shelf hardware and both its hardware blueprints and the required software have been published under an open license to allow scientists and practitioners to replicate the system. We tested the suitability of radio telemetry and audio sensors as camera triggers and evaluated the detection of individuals in video recordings compared to radio telemetry signals. Specifically, BatRack was used to monitor the individual swarming behaviour of six members of a maternity colony of Bechstein's bat. Preliminary anecdotal results indicate that swarming intensity is related to reproductive state and roost switching. BatRack allows researchers to recognize individual bats and monitor their behavioural patterns using an easily deployed and scalable system. BatRack is thus a promising approach to obtaining detailed insights into the behavioural ecology of bats.",1,1
Barbastelle bats in a wind farm: are they at risk?,"We need to know if and how western barbastelles Barbastella barbastellus are affected by wind farming in Sweden. This is because wind turbines are frequently constructed in barbastelle habitats and yet there is no national guideline on how the arising conflict should be handled. We studied the movement, behavior and mortality of a barbastelle population at a wind farm in southern Sweden, using radio-telemetry, automatic bat detectors and carcass searches. The tagged bats (6 males and 8 females) roosted mainly under loose bark of dead oak trees and foraged in patches of mature deciduous woodlands or pockets of mature spruce trees within 15 km of the roosts. Extensive areas of young spruce plantation, open farmland and lakes were not used for roosting or foraging but were crossed by commuting bats. Continuous recordings with bat detectors frequently picked up barbastelles at forest edges 30 m from the turbines, but rarely over the turbine pads within 10 m from the turbines and never at heights of 30 and 100 m at the turbine towers. Barbastelles were apparently not attracted to the wind turbines and did not seem to interact with them in any way. Carcass searches under 10 wind turbines at 1-week intervals over three summers did not reveal any dead barbastelles, although three other species were recovered. We conclude that wind farming is not nessarily incompatible with effective conservation of barbastelles in Sweden, but instead of focusing on wind turbines, effors should concentrate on (a) preservation and restoration of mature, age-structured deciduous woodlands and spruce forests, including very small and isolated patches, which provide food and roosts, and probably also (b) avoidance of outdoor lighting in areas used by barbastelles. Designating large circular buffer zones around each known or suspected colony according to current practice would be inefficient or meaningless in our case, because barbastelles use extensive home ranges and switch roost frequently. We argue that barbastelle management must be applied on a landscape scale.",1,1
Determination of Spatiotemporal Parameters in Straight Drive Cricket Bat Swing using Accelerometer Sensors,"The position, velocity and timing of a cricket bat swing measured in practice and during a match can provide a coach with details of batting skill. A straight drive was analyzed using data from two triaxial accelerometers mounted on the rear face of a bat and a video. The spatiotemporal details from the video were used to match the accelerometer data using rigid body dynamics in the plane of the swing. Discriminating the drive from the backlift and the return, the key issues of the swing motion and bat posture was investigated. The start and the end of the drive can be readily determined from the accelerometer data, and from this, the maximum bat swing velocity was determined. The accelerometer technology can be deployed during practice and match batting for skill assessment. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",0,0
An improved chemiluminescent tag for bats,"Chemical lights and gelatin capsules prepared using Cyalume(R) fluid are widely used by researchers and public educators to mark bats, but may be associated with risks to bats from Cyalume leakage. Newly available 2.9-mm x 24-mm lightsticks weigh significantly less than gelatin-capsule light tags and are protected by a durable plastic shell that reduces risks to bats. We tested Cyalume as a wetting agent on bat fur and compared effects of biting and chewing, duration of visibility, and maximum distance of visibility for miniature lightsticks and gelatin-capsule light tags. We found that Cyalume leaked from gelatin capsules, which softened and ruptured after explosure to chewing and saliva, precipitation, and high humidity. Bats did not puncture or damage the miniature lightsticks. There was no significant difference in duration of luminescence or maximum distance of visibility between miniature lightsticks and gelatin-capsule light tags. Miniature lightsticks provided equal or superior results to gelatin-capsule light tags as a light-tagging technique under field conditions.",0,0
Returning bats to the wild... An experiment in release,"This case study details the successful release of different aged Pallid Bats-Antrozous pallidus pacificus. Two were raised from the age of three days and one of the bats had been captive for over four years. Many in the rehabilitation community have long thought that hand-raised bat pups could not survive in the wild after being raised by humans. This study demonstrates that, with some planning, Pallid Bats can successfully be released into the wild.",0,0
Using sutures to attach miniature tracking tags to small bats for multimonth movement and behavioral studies,"Determining the detailed movements of individual animals often requires them to carry tracking devices, but tracking broad-scale movement of small bats (<30g) has been limited by transmitter technology and long-term attachment methods. This limitation inhibits our understanding of bat dispersal and migration, particularly in the context of emerging conservation issues such as fatalities at wind turbines and diseases. We tested a novel method of attaching lightweight global positioning system (GPS) tags and geolocating data loggers to small bats. We used monofilament, synthetic, absorbable sutures to secure GPS tags and data loggers to the skin of anesthetized big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in Colorado and hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) in California. GPS tags and data loggers were sutured to 17 bats in this study. Three tagged bats were recaptured 7months after initial deployment, with tags still attached; none of these bats showed ill effects from the tag. No severe injuries were apparent upon recapture of 6 additional bats that carried tags up to 26days after attachment; however, one of the bats exhibited skin chafing. Use of absorbable sutures to affix small tracking devices seems to be a safe, effective method for studying movements of bats over multiple months, although additional testing is warranted. This new attachment method has the potential to quickly advance our understanding of small bats, particularly as more sophisticated miniature tracking devices (e.g., satellite tags) become available.",1,1
Roosting behaviour and the tree-hollow requirements of bats: insights from the lesser long-eared bat (Nyctophilus geoffroyi) and Gould's wattled bat (Chalinolobus gouldii) in south-eastern Australia,"Access to suitable roosts is critical for the conservation of tree-hollow roosting bats worldwide. Availability of roost sites is influenced by human land-use, but also by the roosting requirements and behaviour of species. Weinvestigated roosting behaviour of the lesser long-eared bat (Nyctophilus geoffroyi) and Gould's wattled bat (Chalinolobus gouldii) in a rural landscape in south-eastern Australia. Forty-five N. geoffroyi and 27 C. gouldii were fitted with radio-transmitters, resulting in the location of 139 and 89 roosts, respectively. Most (88%) roosts occupied by male N. geoffroyi contained only a single individual. During the breeding season female colonies were larger, with maternity roosts containing 18.3 +/- 5.7 (s.e.) individuals. Mean colony sizes for C. gouldii were 8.7 +/- 1.4 individuals. Both species shifted roosts frequently: on average, individual N. geoffroyi moved every 2.2 +/- 0.23 days and C. gouldii every 2.2 +/- 0.14 days. Notably, lactating female N. geoffroyi shifted roosts more frequently than non-breeding females. Individuals of both species roosted within a discrete area, with roosts typically <300 m apart; and consistently returned there from foraging up to 12 km distant. This roosting behaviour highlights three important requirements: (1) a relatively large overall number of hollows to support a population; (2) discrete roost areas with a high density of suitable hollows in close proximity; and (3) a range of hollow types to provide the specialised roosts required, particularly for breeding.",1,1
Endangered Myotis bats forage in regeneration openings in a managed forest,"Bat populations face numerous threats, including the loss of forests in which they roost and forage. Present-day forests are commonly managed for timber harvesting, recreation, and wildlife. Understanding bat responses to forest management is crucial for balancing the conservation of endangered bats and forest restoration. We used radio telemetry to study nocturnal movements and habitat selection patterns of female and juvenile bats of two forest-dependent, federally listed bat species in an oak-dominated managed forest. We estimated foraging space use and assessed habitat selection for 33 northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis) and 25 Indiana bats (Myotis sodalis) from May to August 2014-2017 in south-central Indiana, USA. Myotis septentrionalis space use averaged 176 ha and bats selected water, historic thinning, and patch cuts (<= 4 ha) over other habitats, with all but one bat avoiding larger openings (>= 4-ha clearcuts). Myotis sodalis space use averaged 343 ha and bats selected 4-ha patch cuts, historic openings, and historic thinning over other habitats. In contrast to M. septentrionalis, one-third of the M. sodalis foraged over larger clearcuts, while two-thirds foraged over smaller openings and thinnings. We showed that bats were attracted to small regeneration harvests of varying structural ages. Forests maintained for a mix of mature stands, thinned stands, shelterwoods, small regenerative cuts (<7 ha), and small water sources should provide suitable foraging habitat for these endangered Myotis species, while also promoting forest regeneration.",1,1
What is driving range expansion in a common bat? Hints from thermoregulation and habitat selection,"Human-induced alterations of ecosystems and environmental conditions often lead to changes in the geographical range of plants and animals. While modelling exercises may contribute to understanding such dynamics at large spatial scales, they rarely offer insights into the mechanisms that prompt the process at a local scale. Savi's pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii) is a vespertilionid bat widespread throughout the Mediterranean region. The species' recent range expansion towards northeastern Europe is thought to be induced by urbanization, yet no study actually tested this hypothesis, and climate change is a potential alternative driver. In this radio telemetry study, set in the Vesuvius National Park (Campania region, Southern Italy) we provide insights into the species' thermal physiology and foraging ecology and investigate their relationships with potential large-scale responses to climate, and land use changes. Specifically, we test whether H. savii i) exploits urbanisation by selecting urban areas for roosting and foraging, and ii) tolerates heatwaves (a proxy for thermophily) through a plastic use of thermoregulation. Tolerance to heatwaves would be consistent with the observation that the species' geographic range is not shifting but expanding northwards. Tracked bats roosted mainly in buildings but avoided urban habitats while foraging, actively selecting non-intensive farmland and natural wooded areas. Hypsugo H. savii showed tolerance to heat, reaching the highest body temperature ever recorded for a free ranging bat (46.5 degrees C), and performing long periods of overheating. We conclude that H. savii is not a strictly synurbic species because it exploits urban areas mainly for roosting, and avoids them for foraging: this questions the role of synurbization as a range expansion driver. On the other hand, the species' extreme heat tolerance and plastic thermoregulatory behaviour represent winning traits to cope with heatwaves typical of climate change related weather fluctuations.",1,1
Winter Roosting by Eastern Red Bats in Ozark Mountain Forests of Missouri,"The eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis Muller, 1776) is a widespread species that roosts in evergreen or dead foliage suspended in trees during winter but retreats to leaf litter during colder periods. Roosting in leaf litter by eastern red bats makes them vulnerable to prescribed fires in winter. Using radio telemetry, we tracked 33 male eastern red bats to 101 winter (November-February) roosts and quantified roost locations, habitat surrounding roosts, and landscape attributes of roost locations. When roosting in trees, bats preferred oaks but generally avoided other tree species; they used pines in proportion to their availability. During colder periods, bats retreated to roosts in leaf litter where 21% suffered mortality either from predation/scavenging or unknown causes while roosting on the ground. Models of roost selection indicated that southerly aspect was the most important factor determining roost selection, and both tree- and leaf-litter roosts were predominately (>= 94%) on upper south-facing slopes. Prescribed burning in late morning/early afternoon on clear days when temperatures under leaf litter are warmest in winter could reduce potential mortality by allowing faster arousal time for hibernating bats.",1,1
Use of space by frugivorous bats (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae) in a restored Atlantic forest fragment in Brazil,"We studied patterns in the use of space for foraging and roosting by two frugivorous bat species in a five-year-old restored Atlantic forest located in a fragmented landscape in southeastern Brazil. Ten individuals of Carollia perspicillata and eleven individuals of Artibeus lituratus were monitored through radio-telemetry in five sampling sessions. Each session lasted 3-8 days for each individual, with an average of 25.4 +/- 10 locations for each C. perspicillata individual and 19 +/- 4.4 for each A. lituratus individual. We described an average range of 124.4 ha and an average commuting distance of 1158.8 m for A. lituratus and an average range and commuting distance of 32 ha and 489 m, respectively, for C. perspicillata. We demonstrated a consistent pattern in habitat use and movements for both studied species, where they strictly used forests (restored or not) for day roosting, roosting in the foliage of trees located only in secondary forest remnants and restored areas, while restored areas were their main feeding habitat. We demonstrate that newly restored forests can be readily incorporated as foraging and roosting habitats by these species, and that C. perspicillata alters its roosting behavior in relation to preferred food availability. These results, when combined with data on the diet of the studied species, show consistent evidence of the potential that bats have to improve species diversity of anthropogenic plantings with their own natural seed dispersal.

Influence of moonlight on the foraging behaviour of the Indian short-nosed fruit bat Cynopterus sphinx: Radio-telemetry studies,"The foraging activity of the Indian short-nosed fruit bat, Cynopterus sphinx was studied using radiotelemetry. The foraging activity gets modulated with different phases of the moon. During bright moonlit nights these frugivorous bats exhibit less activity as against that during new moon nights.",1,1
Bat roosts in Tasmania's production forest landscapes: importance of mature forest for maternity roosts,"Mature forest is a key resource for hollow-using bats, but its importance in shaping where bats roost during breeding is not well understood. This lack of understanding limits the ability of forest managers to make informed decisions on the type, amount and spatial arrangement of mature forest to retain for bats in areas used for timber production. Using radio-telemetry, day roosts of three sympatric hollow-using bat species - the chocolate wattled bat (Chalinolobus morio), the Tasmanian long-eared bat (Nyctophilus sherrini) and the lesser long-eared bat (Nyctophilus geoffroyi) - were located in two forested landscapes in south-eastern Tasmania, Australia. By radio-tracking 24 bats in the maternity season, 76 roosts were located, with interspecific variation in roosting preferences evident at the roost, patch and landscape scale. Maternal colonies showed a clear selection for roosting in areas of the landscape containing the highest availability of mature forest, with smaller patches, strips and individual trees used to a greater extent for roosting in the landscape where mature forest was scarce. These findings showcase the importance of retaining mature forest at multiple spatial scales for hollow-using bats.",1,1
"Habitat use by bats, Myotis spp., in western Newfoundland","Bat diversity and activity patterns were monitored using mist-nets and bat detectors, and roosting habitat was investigated using radio-telemetry in western Newfoundland during June-Angust 1995. Of the three species of bat known to occur in Newfoundland (Lasiurus cinereus, Myotis lucifugus, and M. seprentrionalis), only the latter two were detected or captured. Myotis bats were recorded with detectors at 87% of the riparian sample sites, although at relatively low levels (mean of 19.4 commuting passes/hr). These detector results suggest that myotis bats are ubiquitous, yet not very abundant in western Newfoundland. Most captures were of M lucifugus (66%, n = 30), yet M, septentrionalis appear to be more common than previously thought, representing 34% (n = 15) of the captures. Myotis bats roosted in holes (n = 4), in cracks (n = 2), and under loose bark (n = 2) of standing dead trees, generally close to cutblock edges and sources of water (presumably foraging sites). Compared to those trees available (based on random transects in cutblocks and forests), bats did not appear to select roost trees based on many of the characteristics I measured (% bark remaining, diameter at breast height, stand slope, or species group (deciduous or conifer)). However, bats tended to select roost trees of smaller height classes (0-5 and 11-15 m) and with greater numbers of cavities than those available. Because most roosts were located along edge habitat, forest harvesting may increase accessibility to roosts for some bats by creating corridors and openings through the forest. However, it is still unclear how habitat fragmentation and loss of forested areas may affect but populations.",1,1
Importance of urban trees and buildings as daytime roosts for bats,"Roosts are a very important resource for bats, and often play a central role in conservation projects. To evaluate the feasibility of identifying urban bat roosts, we trapped 30 individual bats from seven species, attached radio transmitters and located their daytime roosts. This enabled us to build hypothesis on the importance of trees and buildings as daytime roosts for urban bats. None of the captured animals were reproducing or lactating, so we assumed all recorded roosts to be simple daytime roosts. Of the 30 marked bats, 18 individuals (six species) could be monitored, and a total of 114 roosts were located; 57 of which were in trees, and another 57 in buildings. Our results indicate that neither building condition nor green coverage in the immediate (<= 20 m) surroundings of a building was a significant predictor for the presence of roosts in or on a building. For tree roosts, diameter at breast height (DBH) was the most important factor determining the choice of tree roosts, but was found insignificant in a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. We presume that the lack of significance regarding green coverage and DBH in the model can be explained by the limited sample size of our study.",1,1
Using on-board sound recordings to infer behaviour of free-moving wild animals,"Technological advances in the last 20 years have enabled researchers to develop increasingly sophisticated miniature devices (tags) that record an animal's behaviour not from an observational, external viewpoint, but directly on the animals themselves. So far, behavioural research with these tags has mostly been conducted using movement or acceleration data. But on-board audio recordings have become more and more common following pioneering work in marine mammal research. The first questions that come to mind when recording sound on-board animals concern their vocal behaviour. When are they calling? How do they adjust their behaviour? What acoustic parameters do they change and how? However, other topics like foraging behaviour, social interactions or environmental acoustics can now be addressed as well and offer detailed insight into the animals' daily life. In this Review, we discuss the possibilities, advantages and limitations of on-board acoustic recordings. We focus primarily on bats as their active-sensing, echolocating lifestyle allows many approaches to a multi-faceted acoustic assessment of their behaviour. The general ideas and concepts, however, are applicable to many animals and hopefully will demonstrate the versatility of on-board acoustic recordings and stimulate new research.",0,0
Tree selection and landscape analysis of eastern red bat day roosts,"Declining bat populations and increasing demands on forest resources have prompted researchers to investigate tree roost selection of forest bats. Few studies, however, have investigated different spatial scales and landscape pattern as criteria for selection of tree roosts. In 1999 and 2000, we radiotracked 23 eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis) to 64 day roosts. Using univariate and multivariate comparisons, we tested roost tree variables with random tree data at 3 circular spatial scales: roost tree, plot, and landscape. We found 15 variables that were entered in a stepwise discriminant analysis to best differentiate between the roost and random samples; 11 (73.3%) were landscape variables measured with a geographic information system. On average (x +/- SE), red bats roosted in deciduous trees (42.0 +/- 2.1 cm dbh) that were located in plots with more (3.1 +/- 0.1 m(2)) basal area, higher (84.0 +/- 1.3) percentage of canopy closure, and lower (27.2 +/- 2.2) percentage of groundcover than random plots. At the landscape scale (by percent magnitude), red bat buffers (1,000-m-radius circle) had significantly less development (81.6%), less feeding operations (70.4%), more deciduous (52.9%) and pine forest (63.8%), and fewer local roads (5.4%) but more trails (94.1%), open water (61.4%), wetland areas (80.4%), and stream areas (63.1%) than random buffers. Red bat roost trees were significantly closer (chi(2) = 22.0088, df = 1, P <= 0.001) to trails (106.2 +/- 13.3 m) than to streams (279.4 +/- 28.5 m). Our results suggest that red bats in our study area select roosts in mature riparian forests near trails, open water, and wetlands. The high percentage of landscape values in the discriminant analysis lends support to using landscape metrics as an investigative technique of resource selection. We recommend that managers consider landscape factors when protecting red bat day-roost habitat.",1,1
Aspen Populus tremula is a key habitat for tree-dwelling bats in boreonemoral and south boreal woodlands in Norway,"This study aims to identify which tree species bats use as maternity roosts in woodland in southern Norway and, to assess the effectiveness of bat boxes as potential mitigating measures if roosts are lost to forestry or other factors. Radio telemetry was used to find roosts in summer during late pregnancy and through the lactation period by tagging two common species; Daubenton's bats Myotis daubentonii (Kuhl 1817) and soprano pipistrelles Pipistrellus pygmaeus (Leach 1825). In addition, tree roosts were searched using ultrasound detectors at three sites. A total of 35 roosts in natural crevices were found using radio telemetry and through searches with ultrasound detectors and 31 of these roosts were in hollow trees, the majority in aspens Populus tremula L. (n=30). Some tree roosts were even used by the northern bat Epteskus nilssonii (Keyserling & Blasius 1839) which is considered a house-dwelling species in Norway. Aspens have some qualities preferred by bats and were both warmer and safer than other hollow tree species in this study area. Bat boxes are used as maternity roosts mainly by soprano pipistrelles at these latitudes, thus at present, there is no suitable alternative to hollow trees that would satisfy all tree-dwelling bat species.",1,1
"Swarming behaviour, catchment area and seasonal movement patterns of the Bechstein's bats: implications for conservation","Bats display marked seasonality throughout the temperate zone and use different habitats during different parts of the year. Unfortunately, detailed information regarding seasonal distribution and movements is often lacking, thereby hampering the development of adequate conservation measures. In this study we used radio telemetry to track females of the endangered Bechstein's bat (Myotis bechsteinii) from autumn swarming sites to their summer maternity colony ranges. We were able to tag 22 individuals, 18 of which were subsequently recovered at nine roost sites up to 20.6 km away. Females from multiple colonies visited the same swarming site on a single night. Concurrently, we recovered females from a single maternity colony at different swarming sites on the same night. The catchment area of the investigated swarming sites measured 27.1 km(2), and was skewed to the northwest. Tagged bats were recovered in forest fragments ranging in size from 5.42 to 128.98 ha. Notably, all but one of the recovered roosts were found in forests that have been continuously wooded since at least 1775. Surveys during the summer at these sites confirmed the presence of maternity colonies at six out of seven locations that could be investigated. Our study contributes to our understanding of swarming behavior and seasonal movement patterns, and exemplifies how these can be used to complete the year-round habitat use of bat species.",1,1
Diet and prey selection in the trawling long-fingered bat,"The diet of the long-fingered bat Myotis capaccinii is poorly known, and there is no previously recorded information on this species' prey preferences. To investigate these subjects, we captured 51 individuals at a nursery cave in the Iberian Peninsula, from pre-breeding to post-lactation seasons. Each bat's diet composition was assessed by faecal content analysis and its foraging places (rivers, pools and channels) identified by radio-telemetry. To estimate prey availability, we sampled arthropods in the individual bats' identified foraging places and also emulated the bats' hunting technique. The bats' diet comprised of arthropods, dominated by small insects with aquatic larvae and flying adult phases. The most consumed taxon was Nematocera (mainly Chironomidae), including adults and pupae, which were also found to be the most abundant prey over water. Other frequently consumed prey were brachycerans, lepidopterans, arachnids, trichopterans and neuropterans. Diet proportions were compared with prey availability to infer a rank of preferences. The preferred prey were lepidopterans and arachnids, both having a terrestrial life cycle and a bigger size than any other taxa consumed. Without discarding the possible underestimation of prey's aerial availability, the observed preference pattern seems to be a consequence of selection for size more than for specific taxa. Apparently M. capaccinii efficiently exploit water-related prey according to availability when the bats hunt low over the water's surface, and are also able to take more profitable prey found higher in the air.",1,1
Triacylglyceride (TAG) profiles of integumentary lipids isolated from three bat species determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS),"Lipids secreted from sebaceous glands in bat integument may play a role in determining host pathogenicity by the fungus Geomyces destructans in white-nose syndrome (WNS). To investigate this, we have determined the triacylglycerol (TAG) profiles for three bat species: eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis (Muller, 1776)), evening bats (Nycticeius humeralis (Rafinesque, 1818)), and big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus (Beauvois, 1796)). Neutral lipids extracted from the hair and wing tissue were fractionated by preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) into four major lipid bands corresponding to cholesterol, free fatty acids (FFAs), TAGs, and sterol wax esters. Densitometry showed higher proportions of TAGs in hair than from wing tissue. TAG bands were recovered and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Mass spectra showed sodiated TAG species with variable fatty acyl (FA) moieties range from m/z 715.6-911.8. High intensity ion peaks were consistent with 16:0 and 18:1 as dominant FA moieties, and these were identified as palmitic and oleic acids, respectively, by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. We determined significant differences in TAG profiles between three bat species by MALDI-TOF MS, providing the first description of integumentary lipids in bats. In this study, we performed the first TAG profiling of bats, which suggest such profiles may be species-specific in bats.",0,0
Warming up for dinner: torpor and arousal in hibernating Natterer's bats (Myotis nattereri) studied by radio telemetry,"The frequency and function of arousals during hibernation in free-living mammals are little known. We used temperature-sensitive radio transmitters to measure patterns of torpor, arousal and activity in wild Natterer's bats Myotis nattereri during hibernation. Duration of torpor bouts ranged from 0.06 to 20.4 days with individual means ranging from 0.9 to 8.9 days. Arousals from torpor occurred most commonly coincident with the time (relative to sunset) typical for bats emerging from summer roosts to forage. Bats with lower body condition indices had a shorter average duration of their torpor bouts. We found a non-linear relationship between duration of torpor bout and ambient temperature: the longest average torpor bouts were at temperatures between 2 and 4A degrees C with shorter bouts at lower and higher ambient temperatures. One individual was radio-tracked for ten nights, remained active for an average of 297 min each night and was active for longer on warmer nights. Our results suggest that vespertilionid bats use relatively short torpor bouts during hibernation in a location with a maritime climate. We hypothesise that Natterer's bats time arousals to maximise opportunities for potential foraging during winter although winter feeding is not the sole determinant of arousal as bats still arouse at times when foraging is unlikely.",1,1
Multi-Scale Assessment of Male Northern Yellow Bat Roost Selection,"Knowledge of roost selection by northern yellow bats (Lasiurus intermedius) is limited to a small number of known roost locations. Yet knowledge of basic life history is fundamental to understanding past response to anthropogenic change and to predict how species will respond to future environmental change. Therefore, we examined male northern yellow bat roost selection on 2 Georgia, USA, barrier islands with different disturbance histories. Sapelo Island has a history of extensive disturbance and is dominated by pine (Pinus spp.) forests; Little Saint Simons Island has a limited disturbance history with maritime oak (Quercus spp.) forest as the dominant cover type. From March-July 2012 and 2013, we radio-tracked 35 adult male northern yellow bats to diurnal roosts and modeled roost characteristics at the plot and landscape scales. We located 387 roosts, of which 95% were in Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides) hanging in hardwood trees. On both islands, bats selected roost trees with larger diameters than surrounding trees and selected roost locations with greater open flight space (i.e., low midstory clutter) underneath. Roosts were located farther from open areas on Sapelo and closer to fresh water on Little Saint Simons compared to random locations. Lower availability of hardwood forest on Sapelo may have resulted in small-scale roost site selection (i.e., plot level) despite potential increased costs of commuting to water and open areas for foraging. In contrast, greater availability of hardwood forest on Little Saint Simons likely allowed selection of roosts closer to fresh water, which provides foraging and drinking opportunities. Our results indicate that mature hardwood trees in areas with low midstory clutter are important in male northern yellow bat roost selection, but landscape-level features have varying influences on roost selection, likely as a result of differences in disturbance history. Therefore, management will differ depending on the landscape context. Further research is needed to examine roost selection by females, which may have different habitat requirements.

Modified Bat Algorithm for Localization of Wireless Sensor Network,"The problem of node localization in wireless sensor networks aims to assign th e geographical coordinates to each device with unknown position, in the deployment area.

Meanwhile the existing bat algorithm has also been modified by using the bacterial foraging strategies of bacterial foraging optimization algorithm. Compared with the existing bat algorithm, the proposed modified bat algorithm is shown through simulations to perform constantly better not only in increasing localization success ratios and fast convergence speed but also enhance its robustness.",0,0
An assessment of radio telemetry for monitoring shorebird chick survival and causes of mortality,"Context. Monitoring survival of free-living precocial avian young is critical for population management, but difficult to achieve. Perhaps the most promising technique available to track survival is the deployment of devices such as radio-transmitters or data loggers, which allow for tracking of the individuals. Aims. To understand if the deployment of radio-transmitters or the process of radio-tracking negatively impact chick survival by analysing survival of tagged chicks. Methods. Fifty masked lapwing (Vanellus miles), 42 red-capped plover (Charadrius ruficapillus) and 27 hooded plover (Thinornis cucullatus) chicks were radio-tracked. Mortality between tagged and untagged chicks within broods was compared to examine whether radio-telemetry influenced chick survival. Key results. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between chicks with and without radio-transmitters. Radio-transmitters enabled the determination of cause of death for 0-28% of radio-tagged chicks. Conclusion. The survival of shorebird chicks does not appear to be affected by attachment of transmitters.",0,0
"Torpor, arousal and activity of hibernating Greater Horseshoe Bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum)","1. Patterns of torpor, arousal and activity in free-living Greater Horseshoe Bats, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (Schreber), were investigated during the hibernation period by using temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters. 2. Torpor bouts varied between 0.1 and 11.8 days, with individual means ranging from 1.3 to 7.4 days. Torpor bout duration decreased with increasing ambient temperature. 3. Activity duration varied from 37 min to 54 h 24 min, with individual means ranging from 2 : 29 to 8 : 58 h. Activity duration increased with ambient temperatures above approximately 10 degreesC. 4. Ten of 11 bats synchronized their arousals with dusk. The circadian rhythm of one bat showed a free-running pattern over a period of about 5 weeks. Arousals were more highly synchronized, and closer to dusk, in individuals with lower body condition. 5. That bats forage in mild weather is supported by the strong synchronization of arousals with dusk, especially in bats with low body condition. 6. Patterns of torpor and subsequent activity are consistent with predictions that torpor lasts until a critical metabolic or water imbalance is achieved. Because metabolism and water loss are temperature-dependent, torpor bout duration decreases with increasing temperature. The imbalance is corrected during subsequent activity, which is relatively constant in duration until a temperature threshold of 10 degreesC, above which increasing levels of foraging lead to longer activity bouts.",1,1
Sensor Node Activation Using Bat Algorithm for Connected Target Coverage in WSNs,"This paper proposes a sensor node activation method using the nature-inspired algorithm (NIA) for the target coverage problem. The NIAs have been used to solve various optimization problems. This paper formulates the sensor target coverage problem into an object function and solves it with an NIA, specifically, the bat algorithm (BA). Although this is not the first attempt to use the BA for the coverage problem, the proposed method introduces a new concept called bat couple which consists of two bats. One bat finds sensor nodes that need to be activated for sensing, and the other finds nodes for data forwarding from active sensor nodes to a sink. Thanks to the bat couple, the proposed method can ensure connectivity from active sensor nodes to a sink through at least one communication path, focusing on the energy efficiency. In addition, unlike other methods the proposed method considers a practical feature of sensing: The detection probability of sensors decreases as the distance from the target increases. Other methods assume the binary model where the success of target detection entirely depends on whether a target is within the threshold distance from the sensor or not. Our method utilizes the probabilistic sensing model instead of the binary model. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms others in terms of the network lifetime.",0,1
50years of bat tracking: device attachment and future directions,"Radiotelemetry and satellite-based telemetry approaches are essential to describe the behaviour and biology of animals. This is especially true for bats, whose small size and cryptic lifestyles make them challenging to study. However, only a handful of studies have evaluated how transmitter mass and the attachment method affect bat behaviour or health, and none have assessed the development of technical methods in the field. We review the past 50years of bat tracking studies to determine how devices have been attached, how guidelines have been followed or changed, and whether any health or fitness impacts from these transmitters can be determined. Half of the nearly 300 studies available used devices heavier than the recommended 5% of body mass with minimal justification. Devices were typically glued directly to the backs of small bats and remained attached for 9days. This is far shorter than battery life span of most devices. Little information is available regarding the overall impact of attaching transmitters on the health, survival and reproductive success of bats, and there has been little development in attachment methods since the first tracking studies. We consequently developed a collar for small bats with a degradable weak link and tested it on several species. The collar worked successfully on three of four species. This allows longer habituation and tracking times while ensuring that the device drops off after the battery expires. Future studies will need to invest more effort in assessing potential long-term effects of tracking. They also need to build upon previous knowledge to find the best attachment method, size and shape for their study species to effectively improve wildlife tracking.",0,0
Optimized Sensor Nodes Deployment in Wireless Sensor Network Using Bat Algorithm,"For the optimal performance of wireless sensor networks in different areas of applications needs to maximize the coverage area of sensor nodes. The coverage of sensor nodes in monitoring region can be improved by using efficient node deployment algorithms. In this paper node deployment based on bat algorithm (BA) is proposed to enhance the coverage rate of nodes. Each bat describes solution for deployment of sensor nodes individually. In bat algorithm based node deployment grid points covered by one sensor node are excluded for remaining sensor nodes. The benefit of eliminating the grid points is that the load on remaining nodes is decreased and there is no chance of overlapping i.e. grid point is covered by only one sensor node. The simulations of node deployment based on BA and fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) are also demonstrated. In this paper to further increase the coverage rate of sensor nodes the performance of various parameters of bat algorithm such as loudness, pulse emission rate, maximum frequency, grid points and sensing radius has been optimized. The simulation results of node deployment based on optimized bat algorithm are also compared with BA and FOA based node deployment in terms of mean coverage rate, computation time and standard deviation. The coverage rate curve for various numbers of iterations and sensor nodes are also presented for optimized bat algorithm, BA and FOA. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of optimized bat algorithm as it achieved more coverage rate than BA and FOA.",0,0
Bat-Firefly Localization Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks,Wireless sensor networks are used in monitoring and control applications. The data gathered by the sensors become meaningful only if the data contains location information.

This is an attempt of collaborating bat algorithm and firefly algorithm to estimate the localization in sensor nodes. Seventy-five percent accuracy is achieved with twenty number of fireflies. The algorithm performs well with better accuracy results as the number of fireflies are increased.,0,0
"Acoustic Lure Allows for Capture of a High-Flying, Endangered Bat","Mist nets are commonly used to capture free-flying bats; however, some bat species are very difficult to capture because of their flight behavior, habitat preferences, and ability to avoid nets. High-flying, open-space foragers are especially underrepresented by mist-net surveys. Few studies have investigated the effectiveness of using acoustic lures (playbacks of conspecific vocalizations) to increase capture success of bats in mist nets. We tested the efficacy of an acoustic lure to capture a high-flying rare molossid, the endangered Florida bonneted bat (Eumops floridanus), which had been captured only once away from a known roost prior to our research. We used a crossover experimental design with 2 lure treatments (nets with lures playing social call recordings from 2 different roosts) and 2 control nets (no lures) in 6 sites for 2 nights each. We captured 15 Florida bonneted bats in our treatment nets and 0 in our control nets. One lure had greater capture success (n=13) than the other (n=2), with a trend for greater captures of males (n=11) than females (n=4). We suggest that these differences were due to the social context in which the calls used in the lures were recorded. Our study demonstrated the utility of acoustic lures to capture Florida bonneted bats and expands research opportunities critical to the species' conservation, such as the ability to use radio telemetry to track captured bats to unknown roosting and foraging areas. Our study also lays the foundation for future research into social call playbacks as a technique to lure other high-flying and elusive bat species into mist nets. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society.",0,0
RELATEDNESS AND GENETIC STRUCTURE OF BIG BROWN BAT (EPTESICUS FUSCUS) MATERNITY COLONIES IN AN URBAN-WILDLAND INTERFACE WITH PERIODIC RABIES VIRUS OUTBREAKS,"Big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) are the bat species in North America most frequently found to be rabid because of their high rate of human contact and thus submissions for rabies testing, of which, 4-5% are positive. The social behavior of big brown bats during the summer months may drive space use and potential viral exposure to conspecifics and mesocarnivores. We collected 88 unique genetic samples via buccal swabs from big brown bats captured at four maternity roosts surrounding a golf course during the summer of 2013. We used seven microsatellite loci to estimate genetic relatedness among individuals and genetic structure within and among colonies to infer whether females selected roosts based on kinship and used genetics and radio telemetry to determine the frequency of roost switching. We found roost switching through genetics and telemetry, and no evidence of elevated genetic relatedness within colonies or genetic structure among colonies. Social cohesion based on relatedness may not act to constrain the pathogen to a particular roost area, and thus, geographic mobility may increase viral exposure of bats in neighboring areas.",1,1
"Roost site selection in pregnant and lactating soprano pipistrelles (Pipistrellus pygmaeus Leach, 1825) at the species northern extreme: the importance of warm and safe roosts","In summer reproducing female bats prefer roosts with temperatures in their thermo neutral zone, but in northern Europe, such roosts may be difficult to find. In this study, summer roost site selection of pregnant and lactating soprano pipistrelles were investigated using radio telemetry (2004-2006) in a fiord landscape with complex topography at the species northern extreme. The soprano pipistrelles' common roost sites were in hollow trees (n = 14), but they also used crevices in rock walls (n = 2) and the attic of one building. The bats exclusively sought out roosts on the north side of the fiord with the slope facing south, where solar irradiation yielded the warmest micro climate. From 2005 to 2014, bat boxes were erected at three sites in the study area. From 2012 to 2014 we only found maternity roosts in such structures, thus there was a clear shift in roost site selection by the soprano pipistrelle in the study area. Man-made structures, such as buildings and bat boxes, provided the warmest cavities, whereas natural cavities did not differ significantly from air temperatures. The bats did not find thermo neutral roosts most of the time, and this should affect the energy budgets, and thus the bats' behaviour. Direct observation of predation at roosts in build-up areas suggests that living close to humans could be costly to bats emerging in daylight conditions. No predation attempts were recorded at roosts in woodland habitats.",1,1
Seasonal variation in home range size of evening bats (Nycticeius humeralis) in an urban environment,"Despite the negative impacts of urbanization on bats, green spaces in urban environments, such as parks, cemeteries, and golf courses, have the potential to provide resources necessary for these animals. Water resources in these areas include natural or semi-natural ponds, streams, and drainage ditches. Such water resources, however, are frequently ephemeral when subject to prolonged periods of high temperatures and low precipitation. We hypothesized that home ranges of evening bats (Nycticeius humeralis) would increase in size or shift from urban green spaces into surrounding neighborhoods to access alternative resources, such as residential swimming pools, when water resources in green spaces are scarce. To explore whether seasonal variations in bat home ranges occurred, we radio-tracked resident evening bats in a local park system during their summer activity period 2017-2019 in Fort Worth, Texas, USA. We used Local Convex Hulls created by associating point locations with their nearest neighbor to estimate home range size, location, and the percentage area that fell within the surrounding neighborhood. We compared these variables to temperature and precipitation using various regression models. We successfully tracked 30 bats over the 3-year period and found a positive correlation between home range size and temperature. Home range sizes increased 6-fold when temperatures exceeded 30 degrees C. Our study indicates the importance of urban neighborhoods surrounding green spaces in providing alternative resources, such as water, for bats. If managed appropriately, these urban areas have the potential to act as oases for bat populations.",1,1
Thermal energetics of male courtship song in a lek-breeding bat,"The use of songs for mate-attraction is common. Intensive songs may indicate high energetic investment, reflecting an individual's resource-holding potential and attractiveness as a prospective mate. Consequently, there can be a direct relationship between song metrics and lifetime reproductive success. While singing is held to be energetically costly, quantitative studies in mammals are lacking. Here, we present an exploratory analysis of energetic costs in a singing bat (Mystacina tuberculata). We recorded the songs of 12 male bats and quantified skin temperature (T-sk) responses using temperature telemetry to estimate energy expenditure. We hypothesised that singing would be energetically costly and predicted correlations between T-sk and song duty cycle and between duty cycle and body size. Contrary to our expectations, we found estimated energetic expenditure while singing to be comparatively low. We also found no relationship between estimated energy expenditure and duty cycle, and neither estimated energy expenditure nor duty cycle was correlated with body size. Our results suggest that energetic costs of singing in bats may be lower than previously assumed, and that song output may convey only limited fitness information. Significance statement Song is commonly used to communicate information related to mate-attraction or territory defence. Some aspects of song production require more energy to produce, making them an honest signal of a singer's investment. While our knowledge of bird song and its relationship to mating success is well developed, a similar understanding regarding mammalian song is severely lacking. Numerous bat species produce song, yet we know little about the energetics of song production in this large and diverse order. Using temperature telemetry, we estimate the costs of singing in a free-living lek-breeding bat. To our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the energetic costs of song production in a mammal.",1,1
Development of a frequency-modulated ultrasonic sensor inspired by bat echolocation,"Bats have evolved to sense using ultrasonic signals with a variety of different frequency signatures which interact with their environment. Among these signals, those with time-varying frequencies may enable the animals to gather more complex information for obstacle avoidance and target tracking. Taking inspiration from this system, we present the development of a sonar sensor capable of generating frequency-modulated ultrasonic signals. The device is based on a miniature mobile computer, with on board data capture and processing capabilities, which is designed for eventual autonomous operation in a robotic swarm. The hardware and software components of the sensor are detailed, as well their integration. Preliminary results for target detection using both frequency-modulated and constant frequency signals are discussed.",1,0
Roost-site preferences of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) in the Pend d'Oreille Valley in southern British Columbia,"I examined the roost-site preferences of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) in the Pend d'Oreille River Valley (POV) in southern British Columbia during the summer of 1995. Roost trees were located via radio-telemetry, then observed at dusk to confirm use and determine colony sizes. I found a total of 27 roost trees used by the two species. Both big brown bats and silver-haired bats preferred large trees (either tail or with a large DBH) that were uncluttered by surrounding trees relative to available trees in the immediate vicinity of the roost, and in other areas of the same stand. Both species preferred trembling aspen. Big brown bats preferred trees in decay stages two and six, whereas silver-haired bats exhibited no decay-stage preferences. When the tree and site characteristics of roost trees used by big brown bats and silver-haired bats were compared, only the height of the tree relative to canopy height discriminated between them. Big brown bats prefer trees that are higher relative to the canopy than silver-haired bats. This information it as used to develop a set of management recommendations for maintaining bat roosting habitat in the POV.",1,1
The activity of an insectivorous bat Neoromicia nana on tracks in logged and unlogged forest in tropical Africa,"Logging activities and the associated creation of roads and tracks can disturb and fragment forests, which may lead to a loss of forest-dependent species and possibly favour nonforest generalists and edge species. The effects of such disturbance are poorly known for African insectivorous bats. We studied the activity patterns of insectivorous bats in a tropical African forest at Kibale National Park, Uganda, using an Anabat bat detector. The echolocation calls of the vespertilionid bat Neoromicia nana were the most frequently detected. This species was most active in the first 5 h after sunset with activity declining rapidly after midnight until sampling finished at 01:00 h. There was no difference in activity of N. nana levels between logged or undisturbed forest; however, this species exhibited higher levels of activity along the wide tracks running through the two forests than either 30 m off these tracks or along the narrow forest trails. The wing morphology and echolocation call of N. nana may be constraining it to flying in uncluttered space on the edge of the forest, penetrating mostly along wider tracks and roads. Further research (in particular radio-telemetry) is required to test and validate these data.Resume",0,0
Adaptive Roosting Gives Little Brown Bats an Advantage over Endangered Indiana Bats,"In recent decades tree roosts of endangered Indiana bats (Myotis sodalis) have been more heavily studied than those of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), a much more common sympatric bat species. Motivated by precipitous declines in both species' populations, we attempted to address this inconsistency by comparing the characteristics of these sibling species' roosts. We used radio telemetry to find roosts of adult female bats of both species in two sites in southern Illinois and two sites in south-central Indiana. We then collected data on roost characteristics and bat movements. Little brown bats used more anthropogenic roosts and crevice/cavity roosts than Indiana bats, which used exfoliating bark roosts almost exclusively. Additionally, both species roosted in similar tree genera with similar DBHs (diameter at breast height) and roost heights. However, little brown bats roosted in shorter trees and in bigger clusters (based on emergence counts) than Indiana bats. Both species moved similar distances between roosts. However, little brown bats switched roosts slightly less often than Indiana bats. The potential preference for natural crevice/cavity roosts by little brown bats may have been a pre-adaptation that allowed the species to take advantage of the rapidly growing availability of crevice/cavity mimicking anthropogenic roosts during the spread of Europeans throughout North America.",1,1
Doppler-shift compensation in the Taiwanese leaf-nosed bat (Hipposideros terasensis) recorded with a telemetry microphone system during flight,"Biosonar behavior was examined in Taiwanese leaf-nosed bats (Hipposideros terasensis; CF-FM bats) during flight. Echolocation sounds were recorded using a telemetry microphone mounted on the bat's head. Flight speed and three-dimensional trajectory of the bat were reconstructed from images taken with a dual high-speed video camera system. Bats were observed to change the intensity and emission rate of pulses depending oil the distance from the landing site. Frequencies of the dominant second harmonic constant frequency component (CF2) of calls estimated from the bats' flight speed agreed strongly with observed values. Taiwanese leaf-noscd bats changed CF2 frequencies depending on flight speed, which caused the CF2 frequencies of the Doppler-shifted echoes to remain constant. Pulse frequencies were also estimated using echoes returning directly ahead of the bat and from its sides for two different flight conditions: landing and U-turn. Bats in flight may periodically alter their attended angles from the front to the side when emitting echolocation pulses. (c) 2005 Acoustical Society of America.",1,1
Compensation behaviors in echolocating bats measured by a telemetry microphone during flight,"Some echolocating bat species are well known to compensate for the Doppler shifts in the echoes by changing their pulse frequencies so that the echo frequencies remain constant at which the bats can hear best. This behavior is termed Doppler-shift compensation and is an important behavioral adaptation for echolocating bats. In this study, we present the evidence for another compensation mechanism of echolocating bats, in which pulse intensity is adjusted in relation to the distance to a target resulting in maintenance of a constant intensity of the echo. Our custom-made telemetry microphone (Telemike) mounted on the back of the bat allowed us to observe not only the emitted pulses, but also the returning echoes which the flying bat actually listened to. The signal characteristics of pulse-echo pairs were analyzed combining with a high-speed video camera system as a bat flying toward the wall on which a landing mesh was attached in the flight chamber. We found that pulse intensity in bats intending to land exhibited a marked decrease by approximately 30 dB within 2 m of distance from the target wall, and the mean reduction rate was 6.5 dB per halving of distance. In contrast, the intensity of echoes returning from the target wall at the head of the flying bat indicated a nearly constant intensity while approaching the target wall. These findings provide direct evidence that bats are supposed to adjust pulse intensity to compensate for changes in echo intensity to maintain a constant intensity within the range necessary for optimal signal processing (echo-intensity compensation).",1,1
Roost elevation and ambient temperature best predict use of summer heterothermy in eastern red bats,"Temperate bat species cope with environmental temperatures outside their thermoneutral zone through physiological responses, habitat selection, and social roosting. While there have been several studies examining these factors in bat species that form maternity colonies in tree cavities, underneath bark, or in manmade structures, such studies rarely focus on bats that roost solitarily in tree foliage. To better understand the thermal environment of a foliage-roosting bat and how they respond to thermal stimuli, we used temperature-sensitive radio-telemetry and environmental dataloggers to study the eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis) in southeast Ohio. We collected skin temperatures from eight male and nine reproductive female bats in combination with microclimate data from 25 bat roosts and 15 random trees. We found that elevation, minimum ambient temperature, and maximum ambient temperature best predicted bat skin temperatures, while sex had little effect. We also found that trees located at higher elevations had warmer canopy microclimates than those at lower elevations, but temperatures did not differ between roost and random trees. These results show that solitary, foliage-roosting species use torpor extensively in response to cool temperatures during summer. These results have conservation implications, indicating that areas on the landscape with warmer conditions are important for reducing the cost of maintaining euthermic body temperatures. In southeastern Ohio, this includes upland forests, but our data suggest that temperatures at slope positions, and not the elevation itself, are the important habitat feature for eastern red bats.",1,1
A Smart Bat Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Network Deployment in 3-D Environment,"Wireless sensor network deployment in a 3-D environment with an optimal balance of system lifetime, cost, coverage, connectivity, and fault tolerance is a challenging task. Current studies on this task are still very few. In this letter, we propose a two-stage deployment strategy for this task. To implement the strategy, we propose a Bat Algorithm-based meta-heuristic algorithm named Smart Bat Algorithm (SBA). The SBA enhances the searching behaviors of artificial bats to be smarter and more efficient by leveraging decision theory and fuzzy logic techniques. The simulation results indicate that the SBA delivers better and more robust solutions compared with three other popular meta-heuristic algorithms.",0,0
Low Rates of PIT-Tag Loss in an Insectivorous Bat Species,"The rate of loss of tags used to mark individuals is an important consideration in wildlife research and monitoring. Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags (or microchips) generally have high retention rates; however, tag loss rates for small mammals such as insectivorous bats are poorly understood. We double-marked a population of Gould's wattled bats (Chalinolobus gouldii) with forearm bands and PIT tags (with the injection site sealed with surgical adhesive) in January and February 2020 to determine rates of subsequent tag loss over the short- (1-2 months) and medium- (13-14 months) term. Loss of PIT tags occurred in 4 (2.7%) of 146 recaptured individuals, all within 2 months of microchipping. We also recorded 1 occurrence of band loss 11 months after banding. Our study supports assertions that PIT-tag retention rates in small mammals are high, and suggests that rates of tag loss in small bat species are low when surgical adhesive is applied. Quantifying the rate of tag loss enables this variable to be incorporated into mark-recapture models. (c) 2021 The Wildlife Society.",0,0
Winter activity of a population of greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum),"Activity patterns of greater horseshoe bats Rhinolophus ferrumequinum were investigated at caves in Cheddar (south-west England) during the hibernation season. An ultrasound detector and datalogger were used to monitor and record the number of echolocation calls in a single cave. Activity of R. ferrumequinum remained largely nocturnal throughout winter, and the mean time of activity over 24 h was 88 to 369 min after sunset. There was an increase in diurnal activity from late May to early June, probably because bats remained active after foraging at dawn towards the end of the hibernation season. Visits to the cave did not increase bat activity. Cave air temperature reflected external climatic temperature, although there was variation in cave temperature and its range within and among caves. Individual R. ferrumequinum are usually dispersed in caves in regions where temperature fluctuations correlate with climatic variations in temperature. There was a positive correlation between the number of daily bat passes monitored by the bat detector and datalogger (= daily activity) and cave temperature. Nocturnal activity may be sometimes associated with winter feeding. Neither date nor barometric pressure had a significant effect on daily activity. Activity patterns largely reflected the findings from individual R. ferrumequinum studied by telemetry (Park, 1998), in that bat activity increased with cave and climatic temperatures, and the temporal pattern of activity remained consistently nocturnal throughout winter, starting at dusk.",0,0
Multi-sensor Detection Network based on Improved Bat Algorithm.,"In view of the disadvantages of low quality and slow calculation speed in the current establishment of multi-sensor detection network algorithms, this paper introduces an improved bat algorithm to solve the optimal solution of the detection network. The basic bat algorithm was improved by K-means algorithm initialization, speed update using adaptive step size, reverse direction search and mutation operation, and an improved bat algorithm was obtained. Simulation experiments show that the improved algorithm has significantly improved the speed of calculation and optimization. In addition, by comparing the improved bat algorithm with the particle swarm optimization algorithm and bee colony algorithm, it is proved that the proposed algorithm is of higher quality and easier to solve.

Roost selection by Rafinesque's big-eared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) in a pristine habitat at three spatial scales,"Although several studies have described roost use by Rafinesque's big-eared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii), few studies have examined roost selection. We examined roost use and selection by Rafinesque's big-eared bat at the tree, stand, and landscape scales during the maternity season in pristine old-growth habitat in the Coastal Plain of South Carolina. We located 43 roosts (14 maternity, 29 solitary) through cavity searches and radio-telemetry. Maternity colonies and solitary individuals selected roosts based on similar characteristics. The best model explaining roost selection by all bats included tree and stand characteristics; landscape factors had little influence on roost use. Bats selected large diameter trees in areas with a high density of trees with cavities in the surrounding area. Most roosts (67.4%) were in water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) in semi-permanently flooded and saturated areas. Half of maternity roost cavities had upper bole openings whereas only 25.8% of solitary roosts had upper bole openings. Bats that roosted with maternity groups stayed in roosts for significantly shorter periods of time (1.3 +/- 0.1 days) and used significantly more roost trees (5.0 +/- 0.6 roosts) than adult males (3.8 +/- 1.10 days, 2.3 +/- 0.4 roosts, respectively). Maternity colony use of cavities with upper bole openings and shorter residency times suggest that predator avoidance may have been an important factor governing roosting behavior of maternity colonies in this area. Our results suggest that retention of large diameter, hollow trees in wetland areas will benefit Rafinesque's big-eared bat individuals and maternity colonies in this area.",1,1
"Absence of Jamming Avoidance and Flight Path Similarity in Paired Bent-Winged Bats, Miniopterus Fuliginosus","Echolocating bats perceive their surroundings by listening to the echoes of self-generated ultrasound pulses. When multiple conspecifics fly in close proximity to each other, sounds emitted from nearby individuals could mutually interfere with echo reception. Many studies suggest that bats employ frequency shifts to avoid spectral overlap of pulses with other bats. Technical constraints in recording technology have made it challenging to capture subtle changes in the pulse characteristics of bat calls. Therefore, how bats change their behavior to extract their own echoes in the context of acoustic interference remains unclear. Also, to our best knowledge, no studies have investigated whether individual flight paths change when other bats are present, although movements likely reduce acoustic masking. Here, we recorded the echolocation pulses of bats flying alone or in pairs using telemetry microphones. Flight trajectories were also reconstructed using stereo camera recordings. We found no clear tendency to broaden individual differences in the acoustic characteristics of pulses emitted by pairs of bats compared to bats flying alone. However, some bats showed changes in pulse characteristics when in pairs, which suggests that bats can recognize their own calls based on the initial differences in call characteristics between individuals. In addition, we found that the paired bats spend more time flying in the same directions than in the opposite directions. Besides, we found that the flight paths of bats were more similar in paired flight trials than in virtual pairs of paired flight trials. Our results suggest that the bats tend to follow the other bat in paired flight. For the following bat, acoustic interference may be reduced, while the opportunity to eavesdrop on other bats' calls may be increased.",1,0
Beauty and the beast: how a bat utilizes forests shaped by outbreaks of an insect pest,"The consequences of different management strategies following natural disturbances are a matter of global concern. In former production forests around the Northern Hemisphere, the abandonment of intervention, such as removal of dead wood, after outbreaks of bark beetles has been increasingly promoted to regain more natural conditions. However, many focal species of conservation, such as the barbastelle bat Barbastella barbastellus, do not primarily depend on dead wood but might respond indirectly to disturbance-induced changes of forest structural attributes. We investigated the response of B. barbastellus foraging activity and roost selection by combining acoustic surveys, radio telemetry, and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to characterize B. barbastellus habitat use on different scales. B. barbastellus foraging activity increased with increasing canopy opening. Maternity colonies were recorded exclusively in trees killed by bark beetles. Bats preferred roost trees with a higher volume (m(3)ha(-1)) of live trees in the surrounding, and trees with on average larger diameters than nearby control trees. Our results revealed that outbreaks of bark beetles result in forest structural attributes that are suitable habitat for B. barbastellus. Salvage logging, i.e., the removal of beetle-affected trees, generally deteriorates the positive effects of bark-beetle outbreaks on the foraging and roosting habitat of B. barbastellus. We recommend maintaining snags of large diameter if salvage logging is mandatory.",1,1
Node Localization of Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Hybrid Bat-Quasi-Newton Algorithm,"Concerning the problem that the least square method in the third stage of DV-Hop algorithm has low positioning accuracy, a localization algorithm was proposed which is the fusion of hybrid bat-quasi-Newton algorithm and DV-Hop algorithm. First of all, the Bat Algorithm (BA) was improved from two aspects: firstly, the random vector beta was adjusted adaptively according to bats fitness so that the pulse frequency had the adaptive ability. Secondly, bats were guided to move by the average position of all the best individuals before the current iteration so that the speed had variable performance; Then in the third stage of DV-Hop algorithm the improved bat algorithm was used to estimate node location and then quasi-Newton algorithm was used to continue searching for the node location from the estimated location as the initial searching point. The simulation results show that, compared with the traditional DV-Hop algorithm and the improved algorithm of DV-Hop based on bat algorithm (BADV-Hop). Positioning precision of the proposed algorithm increases about 16.5% and 5. 18%, and the algorithm has better stability, it is suitable for high positioning precision and stability situation.",0,0
An effective Bat algorithm for node localization in distributed wireless sensor network,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have recently been extensively investigated due to their numerous applications in processes that have to be spread over a large area. One of the important issues of WSN is node localization; node localization capability is highly desirable for the performance evaluation in monitoring applications. Localization is defined as estimating the locations of sensors with initially unknown location information as most sensors do not know their locations due to the cost and size of sensors. The main objective of localization is to find the nodes' positions in a short time with a low energy cost; for this reason, recent approaches relying on swarm intelligence techniques are utilized, and node localization is considered an optimization problem in a multidimensional space. Recently, the meta-heuristic Bat algorithm was proposed as a solution for the node localization problem. This paper proposes an effective Bat algorithm for the node localization problem, the effectiveness of which is based on the adaptation of velocity of the Bats by hybridization, with Doppler effect for improving the performance, aptly termed Dopeffbat. Hence, Dopeffbat computes (through evolution) the nodes' positions iteratively through the Euclidian distance as fitness. Deploying this algorithm on a large WSN with hundreds of sensors demonstrates decent performance in terms of node localization. Moreover, the Dopeffbat parameters are simulated and interpreted in different scenarios of simulation; in addition, a comparative study was performed to further demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, and the simulation results prove that Dopeffbat has a high convergence rate and greater precision compared with the original Bat algorithm and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms.",0,0
Nine years of Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) spring migration behavior,"The endangered Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) congregates in large hibernation groups in winter and travels after spring emergence to form summer maternity colonies, but information on migration behavior in this species remains limited to mostly band recovery observations. We tracked female Indiana bats in spring migration toward summer grounds using aerial radiotelemetry. Adult female Indiana bats were radiotagged in spring from 2009 through 2017, with 15 individuals successfully tracked to summer grounds and an additional 11 bats located in summer grounds via aerial telemetry after migration was complete. This resulted in the location of 17 previously unknown summer grounds for female Indiana bats, including adding Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the summer maternity range. Two of the colonies identified in this study were south of the previously known southernmost colony in Tennessee, expanding the summer maternity range for the species by 178 km. Time-stamped location fixes along the migration path provided information about nightly and overall distances traveled, duration of travel, migration speed, and weather-related influences on bat behavior. Bats traveled 164.6 +/- 26.2 km (+/- SE) on average from hibernacula to summer grounds and were migrating for an average of 7.3 +/- 1.4 calendar nights. Bats alternated between foraging and traveling throughout each night of their migration route. Nightly migration rate was 9.9 +/- 0.8 km/h and bats were active on the landscape for an average of 6.1 +/- 0.4 h/night. Lower nighttime temperatures and lower barometric pressure correlated with use of layover areas during a migration night. Understanding bat behavior during migration can provide pertinent information for land managers to consider in efforts to conserve potential migration corridors, foraging areas, and roosting habitats of species in decline.",1,1
"Observations on the distribution, ecology, and behaviour of bats on the Galapagos Islands","The distribution of bats on five Galapagos islands was assessed using ultrasonic detectors that can identify the feeding calls of different bat species. Red bats (Lasiurus brachyotis) were present on Santa Cruz and San Cristobal. Hoary bats (L. cinereus) were present on Santa Cruz, San Cristobal, Isabela, Floreana and Santiago. Species identifications were confirmed by recordings of bat calls, observations of flying bats, and the capture of 21 red bats and three hoary bats. There was no evidence of other species of bats on the Galapagos. Body size measurements were similar to those of South American red (L. borealis) and hoary (L. c. villosissimus) bats. Species status of L. brachyotis is not supported by morphological data. Both species were active in lowland and highland habitats, and foraging activity was high around street lights. Radio telemetry was used to locate day roosts and the nightly activity areas of four red bats in lowland areas of Santa Cruz. During the day, these bats roosted singly in the foliage of nine species of plant. Nightly activity areas were 10 to 20 ha in size. The activity areas of individuals overlapped, and included their known day roost sites. Both bat species were apparently more active in lowland habitats during the cool garua season, and less active in lowland habitats during the hot season. Female red bats were more abundant in lowland habitats during the cool season than were male red bats. Mesic, upland habitat may be critical to the survival of bats in the Galapagos.",1,1
"Roost selection by the north Queensland long-eared bat Nyctophilus bifax in littoral rainforest in the Iluka World Heritage Area, New South Wales","The aim of this study was to describe the roosts of Nyctophilus bifax in littoral rainforest in Iluka Nature Reserve on the north coast of New South Wales. Radio-telemetry was used to track 17 bats in November 1988 (lactation season) and 11 in May 1989 (mating season) to 87 roosts in 49 trees within the littoral rainforest. The bats frequently changed roosts, which were clustered within a small area. During November, lactating females moved twins between diurnal roosts and some carried twins while foraging. Twins represented a load of up to 95% of their mother's bodyweight. Bats roosted communally in foliage and tree hollows, beneath peeling bark, among epiphytes, and between strangler figs and host trees. Hollows were used more frequently when bats were lactating, while the use of foliage roosts was greater during the mating season. Roosts were concentrated in four tree species, although a wide range of other tree species was used. Roost trees used in November were taller (17 m) than those used in May (8.2 m), and reflect selection of Syzygium leuhmannii and A cmena hemilampra, both trees of the forest interior. The converse applied for selection of Cupaniopsis anacardioides, a small tree of the littoral zone, in May. These results identify the need for conserving a diversity of roosts for this species of bat.",1,1
Bat species composition and roost use in pinyon-juniper woodlands of New Mexico,"Bat species composition and structures used for maternity colony roosts were investigated in pinyon-juniper habitats of the Cibola National Forest. I mist netted 10 sites with permanent water on four different nights during the summer of 1995. Number of species and total numbers of bats captured ranged from 0-11 species at a site and 0-134 bats in a night. Myotis californicus, M. ciliolabrum, M. volans, M. thysanodes, Eptesicus fuscus, Lasionycteris noctivagans, Lasiurus cinereus, and Tadarida brasiliensis were captured at greater than or equal to 5 sites, although not always in high numbers. Species captured at <5 sites were either locally abundant (e.g., M. evotis) or a rarity (e.g., Euderma maculatum). Radio-telemetry was used to study maternity-roost use by three federal category 2 candidate species. Three M. thysanodes, one M. evotis, and two M. volans roosts were located. M. thysanodes and M. volans roosts with 30 to over 200 bats were found in ponderosa pine snags and live ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) with long, vertical cracks, These snag and live-tree roosts were located in ponderosa pine stringers in drainages between pinyon-juniper slopes or at the interface of ponderosa pine and pinyon-juniper habitats. M, evotis used live and dead junipers exclusively for colony and solitary roosts.",1,1
Seasonality of torpor patterns and physiological variables of a free-ranging subtropical bat,"Seasonal changes in weather and food availability differ vastly between temperate and subtropical climates, yet knowledge on how free-ranging subtropical insectivorous bats cope with such changes is limited. We quantified ambient temperatures, torpor patterns and thermal physiology of subtropical insectivorous northern long-eared bats, Nyctophilus bifax, during summer (n=13) and winter (n=8) by temperature telemetry. As predicted, ambient conditions varied significantly between seasons, with warmer weather during summer. All bats used torpor on 85% of observation days during summer in comparison to 100% during winter. During summer, patterns of torpor varied and the duration of torpor bouts was not significantly affected by ambient temperature, whereas during winter torpor bout duration was negatively correlated with mean ambient temperature. Mean torpor bout duration in summer was 3.2 +/- 1.3 h and in winter was 26.8 +/- 11.3 h . Mean arousal time during summer was in the early afternoon and during winter in the late afternoon, and throughout both seasons arousals for possible foraging periods occurred near sunset. Skin temperature was positively correlated with ambient temperatures in both seasons, but the relationship differed between seasons. We show that torpor is used regularly throughout the year in a free-ranging subtropical bat and provide the first evidence demonstrating that torpor patterns and thermal physiology change with season.",1,1
Low-Weight Wireless Sensor Network for Encounter Detection of Bats,In this paper a compact low weight wireless sensor node for proximity detection is presented.

Eavesdropping on Echolocation: Recording the Bat's Auditory Experience,"Insectivorous bats are able to locate and capture insects in complete darkness while flying at high speeds. They may consume hundreds of insects each night while avoiding obstacles in a complex environment. To investigate the processes associated with bat echolocation, we have developed instrumentation that allows us to record and visualize what a bat hears while flying through its natural environment. Recordings were made using a miniaturized radio telemetry system mounted directly on the back of the bat. This paper describes the design and testing of the components of this system, presents echolocation data collected from bats and discusses issues associated with the visualization and analysis of echoes recorded in a natural setting from the bat's point-of-view. It presents a new tool for visualizing a bat's experience by generating call sequence sonograms (CSSs) based on various signal parameters. CSSs based on time series amplitude, band-limited spectral magnitude and Q-factor are presented. This work demonstrates that CSSs based on Q-factor (computed by dividing a peak frequency estimate by a bandwidth estimate) provides a relatively clear representation of the objects producing echoes encountered by a bat during a continuous flight.",1,1
Does light condition affect the habitat use of soprano pipistrelles Pipistrellus pygmaeus at the species northern extreme?,"This study explores the hunting habitat and activity patterns of the soprano pipistrelle Pipistrellus pygmaeus in relation to insect densities and light conditions during summer at 62 degrees N in western Norway. Here, the first soprano pipistrelles emerge at several thousand lux and are common in woodland at more than 1000 lux. In this study, bats tagged with transmitters emerged from their roosts on average one hour before sunset and were airborne for more than five hours each night. During the first hours they always hunted in woodland, but shifted to hunt above the fiord during the night. This shift occurred on average 2 h and 25 min after evening emergence and 1 h and 30 min after sunset. In addition to using radio telemetry, bat contacts over the fiord were counted using ultrasound detectors and car transects. Simultaneously, insects were collected using suction traps and light levels were measured. There was a highly significant effect of light intensity on the number of bats hunting along the fiord. Predictions based on a second order polynomial generalised linear model (GLM) shows that soprano pipistrelles will start to hunt above the fiord when light levels drop below approximately 25 lux. It also suggests a slight reduction of insects as bat numbers increase along the shoreline. The GLM model explains approximately 92% of the variation in the dataset. Ultrasound recordings show that soprano pipistrelles attack far more prey per effort near the shores compared to areas further away. The results found in this study strongly suggest that habitat selection is a trade-off between food energy intake and other factors, e.g. predation risk.",1,1
Bat-inspired Hair Sensor,"We present the design of a directional airflow sensor inspired by the bat hair sensory system. The design is based on the integration of a MEMS structure with mechanical amplification of a deflecting hair on a suspended membrane together with differential sensing of parallel plate capacitors placed at the base of the hair. We describe the design and show simulations predicting that the structure is capable of detecting airspeeds of 0.5 m/sec in a directionally sensitive fashion. Furthermore, the structure is mechanically simple and inexpensive to fabricate. It has been integrated into a miniature form factor for deployment on the wing of a freely flying bat, and MEMS fabrication is currently underway.",0,0
"Evidence of resource-defense polygyny in an endangered subtropical bat, Eumops floridanus","Understanding sociality and animal behavior is critical for developing effective conservation strategies. Many tropical bat species form harems, where dominant males play key social roles by defending groups of females directly (female-defense polygyny) and/or the resources that females need (resource-defense polygyny). The Florida bonneted bat (Eumops floridanus) is an endangered subtropical species suspected to form harems, but our understanding of its social structure, reproduction, and behavior is rudimentary. In this study, we evaluated demographic variation in morphological and behavioral characteristics of Florida bonneted bats to test the hypothesis that this species forms harem groups and exhibits resource-defense polygyny at roost sites. We used a 4-year dataset of 341 individuals uniquely marked with passive integrated transponders (PIT tags), coupled with tri-annual capture records, to track activity patterns of bats at five roosts fitted with PIT tag readers. We identified the likely dominant males and other demographic groups in each roost using morphometric characteristics and reproductive status. We assessed differences between sexes and among status categories in three primary metrics: amount of activity at the roost, time of emergence, and initial foray duration per night. Dominant males consistently were the most active individuals at roosts and spent the least amount of time away from roosts during forays, relative to females and other males. Females spent more time away from roosts than males and shared similar foraging activity patterns regardless of status. Our findings suggest that Florida bonneted bats form small harem groups that are active year round. Male bats exhibit characteristics of resource-defense polygyny at roost sites and a size-biased hierarchy, with the largest reproductively active males appearing to defend the roost at the expense of time spent foraging. We suggest that the roost site represents a critical, limited and defendable resource for male Florida bonneted bats to gain access to females, which has important implications for the conservation and enhancement of roost sites. Our study highlights the importance of accounting for differences in behavior across demographic groups and social roles when considering resource needs for imperiled species. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

STUDYING THE MIGRATORY BEHAVIOR OF INDIVIDUAL BATS: CURRENT TECHNIQUES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS,"Migrating bats are among the most poorly understood of migratory taxa, with relatively little information available on their behavior and ecology during migration compared to other taxa. This arises because of the small animal problem, namely the limitations of current technology to track individual animals that weigh <190 g. In this paper (which is not a comprehensive review of bat migration) we assess the limits of current techniques available to study the migratory behavior of individual bats and what is needed to take the study of the behavior and ecology of migrating bats forward.",1,0
Fatty Acid Methyl Ester Profiles of Bat Wing Surface Lipids,"Sebocytes are specialized epithelial cells that rupture to secrete sebaceous lipids (sebum) across the mammalian integument. Sebum protects the integument from UV radiation, and maintains host microbial communities among other functions. Native glandular sebum is composed primarily of triacylglycerides (TAG) and wax esters (WE). Upon secretion (mature sebum), these lipids combine with minor cellular membrane components comprising total surface lipids. TAG and WE are further cleaved to smaller molecules through oxidation or host enzymatic digestion, resulting in a complex mixture of glycerolipids (e.g., TAG), sterols, unesterified fatty acids (FFA), WE, cholesteryl esters, and squalene comprising surface lipid. We are interested if fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiling of bat surface lipid could predict species specificity to the cutaneous fungal disease, white nose syndrome (WNS). We collected sebaceous secretions from 13 bat spp. using Sebutape(A (R)) and converted them to FAME with an acid catalyzed transesterification. We found that Sebutape(A (R)) adhesive patches removed similar to 6x more total lipid than Sebutape(A (R)) indicator strips. Juvenile eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis) had significantly higher 18:1 than adults, but 14:0, 16:1, and 20:0 were higher in adults. FAME profiles among several bat species were similar. We concluded that bat surface lipid FAME profiling does not provide a robust model predicting species susceptibility to WNS. However, these results provide baseline data that can be used for lipid roles in future ecological studies, such as life history, diet, or migration.",0,0
Digital gene expression tag profiling of bat digits provides robust candidates contributing to wing formation,"Background: As the only truly flying mammals, bats use their unique wing - consisting of four elongated digits (digits II-V) connected by membranes - to power their flight. In addition to the elongated digits II-V, the forelimb contains one shorter digit (digit I) that is morphologically similar to the hindlimb digits. Here, we capitalized on the morphological variation among the bat forelimb digits to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying digit elongation and wing formation. Using next generation sequencing technology, we performed digital gene expression tag profiling (DGE-tag profiling) of developing digits in a pooled sample of two Myotis ricketti and validated our sequencing results using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) of gene expression in the developing digits of two Hipposideros armiger. Results: Among hundreds of genes exhibiting significant differences in expression between the short and long digits, we highlight 14 genes most related to digit elongation. These genes include two Tbx genes (Tbx3 and Tbx15), five BMP pathway genes (Bmp3, RGMB, Smad1, Smad4 and Nog), four Homeobox genes (Hoxd8, Hoxd9, Hoxa1 and Satb1), and three other genes (Twist1, Tmeff2 and Enpp2) related to digit malformations or cell proliferation. In addition, our results suggest that Tbx4 and Pitx2 contribute to the morphological similarity and five genes (Acta1, Tnnc2, Atp2a1, Hrc and Myoz1) contribute to the functional similarity between the thumb and hindlimb digits. Conclusions: Results of this study not only implicate many developmental genes as robust candidates underlying digit elongation and wing formation in bats, but also provide a better understanding of the genes involved in autopodial development in general.",0,0
Analysis of echolocation behavior of bats in echo space using acoustic simulation,"Background Echolocating bats use echo information to perceive space, control their behavior, and adjust flight navigation strategies in various environments. However, the echolocation behavior of bats, including echo information, has not been thoroughly investigated as it is technically difficult to measure all the echoes that reach the bats during flight, even with the conventional telemetry microphones currently in use. Therefore, we attempted to reproduce the echoes received at the location of bats during flight by combining acoustic simulation and behavioral experiments with acoustic measurements. By using acoustic simulation, echoes can be reproduced as temporal waveforms (including diffracted waves and multiple reflections), and detailed echo analysis is possible even in complex obstacle environments. Results We visualized the spatiotemporal changes in the echo incidence points detected by bats during flight, which enabled us to investigate the echo space revealed through echolocation for the first time. We then hypothesized that by observing the differences in the echo space before and after spatial learning, the bats' attentional position would change. To test this hypothesis, we examined how the distribution of visualized echoes concentrated at the obstacle edges after the bats became more familiar with their environment. The echo incidence points appeared near the edge even when the pulse direction was not toward the edge. Furthermore, it was found that the echo direction correlated with the turn rate of the bat's flight path, revealing for the first time the relationship between the echo direction and the bat's flight path. Conclusions We were able to clarify for the first time how echoes space affects echolocation behavior in bats by combining acoustic simulations and behavioral experiments.",0,0
"Rapid frequency control of sonar sounds by the FM bat, Miniopterus fuliginosus, in response to spectral overlap","In the presence of multiple flying conspecifics, echolocating bats avoid jamming by adjusting the spectral and/or temporal features of their vocalizations. However, little is known about how bats alter their pulse acoustic characteristics to adapt to an acoustically jamming situation during flight. We investigated echolocation behavior in a bat (Miniopterus fuliginosus) during free flight under acoustic jamming conditions created by downward FM jamming sounds mimicking bat echolocation sounds. In an experimental chamber, the flying bat was exposed to FM jamming sounds with different terminal frequencies (TFs) from loudspeakers. Echolocation pulses emitted by the flying bat were recorded using a telemetry microphone (Telemike) mounted on the back of the bat. The bats immediately (within 150 ms) shifted the TFs of emitted pulses upward when FM jamming sounds were presented. Moreover, the amount of upward TF shift differed depending on the TF ranges of the jamming sounds presented. When the TF range was lower than or overlapped the bat's mean TF, the bat TF shifted significantly upward (by 1-2 kHz, Student's t-test, P<0.05), corresponding to 3-5% of the total bandwidth of their emitted pulses. These findings indicate that bats actively avoid overlap of the narrow frequency band around the TF. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",1,1
Energy Consumption in Point-Coverage Wireless Sensor Networks via Bat Algorithm,"Sensor nodes spend the most of their limited energy on communicating with environmental information gathered in receivers. Hence, it is important to determine the optimal monitoring sensor nodes and information flow paths to the destination and sink in order to survive the sensor networks. Additionally, the heavy traffic load for transferring packets in nodes closer to the sink increases energy consumption and reduces battery life. It is desirable to reduce the energy between nodes and sink. The main goal is to extend the network lifetime through extending the lifetime of operating sensors as well transferring gathered data from super node to the sink. In this paper, Bat Algorithm (BA) is used to select the optimum monitoring sensor node and resulted path to reduce energy consumption. Simulation results and comparison with other algorithms show the superiority of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results of the proposed algorithm show that the proposed algorithm has been able to reduce the power consumption of the network and increase the lifetime of the network. Also, the proposed algorithm is able to outperform the comparable algorithms on average by 27%.",0,0
The importance of temporal heterothermy in bats,"Animals must balance their energy budgets even when confronted with periodic food shortages and/or adverse environmental conditions. Especially, small endothermic animals require large amounts of energy to maintain high and stable body temperatures (T-b) via endogenous heat production. To deal with energetic challenges, many small endotherms are heterothermic, abandon regulation of high T-b and enter a state of torpor resulting in large energy savings. Torpor is used by many bat species because they are small, have high rates of heat loss and rely on fluctuating food resources (e.g. insects, fruit, nectar). Many bats use torpor all year, but the expression of temporal heterothermy can be strongly seasonal especially for temperate and subtropical species, which may hibernate for long periods. Recent advances in our understanding of torpor expression in bats have been made using temperature telemetry for remote data collection of T-b in free-ranging wild individuals from all climate zones. This new knowledge on free-ranging bats has revealed the importance of torpor expression not only for energy conservation but also for other benefits, such as reduction of extrinsic mortality (e.g. predation). On the contrary, dense clustering during hibernation, important for minimizing energy and water loss, may also expose bats to infectious disease. An emerging, cold-tolerant fungal pathogen of bats causes a new disease called white-nose syndrome (WNS), which is devastating populations of multiple species in eastern North America. Given the importance of temporal heterothermy to their biology, and links between torpor expression and mortality from WNS, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the ecology and physiology of torpor in this largely understudied and cryptic mammalian group. Here, we review past and current literature to summarize the importance and evolution of heterothermy in bats.",0,0
High detectability with low impact: Optimizing large PIT tracking systems for cave-dwelling bats,"Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag technology permits the resighting of animals tagged for ecological research without the need for physical re-trapping. Whilst this is effective if animals pass within centimeters of tag readers, short-distance detection capabilities have prevented the use of this technology with many species. To address this problem, we optimized a large (15 m long) flexible antenna system to provide a c. 8 m(2) vertical detection plane for detecting animals in flight. We installed antennas at two roosting caves, including the primary maternity cave, of the critically endangered southern bent-winged bat (Miniopterus orianae bassanii) in south-eastern Australia. Testing of these systems indicated PIT-tags could be detected up to 105 cm either side of the antenna plane. Over the course of a three-year study, we subcutaneously PIT-tagged 2,966 bats and logged over 1.4 million unique detections, with 97% of tagged bats detected at least once. The probability of encountering a tagged bat decreased with increasing environmental noise (unwanted signal) perceived by the system. During the study, we mitigated initial high noise levels by earthing both systems, which contributed to an increase in daily detection probability (based on the proportion of individuals known to be alive that were detected each day) from <0.2 (noise level >= 30%) to 0.7-0.8 (noise level 5%-15%). Conditional on a low (5%) noise level, model-based estimates of daily encounter probability were highest (>0.8) during peak breeding season when both female and male southern bent-winged bats congregate at the maternity cave. In this paper, we detail the methods employed and make methodological recommendations for future wildlife research using large antennas, including earthing systems as standard protocol and quantifying noise metrics as a covariate influencing the probability of detection in subsequent analyses. Our results demonstrate that large PIT antennas can be used successfully to detect small volant species, extending the scope of PIT technology and enabling a much broader range of wildlife species to be studied using this approach.",0,0
Natterer's bats prefer foraging in broad-leaved woodlands and river corridors,"We studied habitat selection by radio tracking Natterer's bats Myotis nattereri foraging in a grassland-woodland landscape. We tested the hypothesis that selection of foraging habitat is random at two levels: firstly, the selection of individual foraging ranges and secondly, the choice of foraging habitats made by individuals within these foraging ranges. Habitat selection was random at neither level. When selecting foraging ranges, bats maximized the area of semi-natural broad-leaved woodland and improved grassland and minimized that of dense coniferous plantations. During foraging, semi-natural broad-leaved woodland and river corridors were preferred, while dense coniferous plantations were avoided. Within individual foraging ranges, the intensity of foraging activity over river corridor habitat and semi-natural broad-leaved woodland was 8.2 and 3.8 times higher, respectively, than that over improved grassland. For successful management of Natterer's bat populations, semi-natural broad-leaved woodland should be retained. Clear felling of large blocks of native broad-leaved woodland should be avoided and conifers should not be used for reforestation. Tree cover along river banks should be encouraged and protected.",1,1
Offshore and coastline migration of radio-tagged Nathusius' pipistrelles,"The wind energy-bat conflict is well documented for the onshore sector, with high numbers of casualties, specifically for migratory bat species. Offshore wind turbines might be a threat to bats as well, yet offshore bat migration is poorly documented. Accordingly, potential conflicts between bat conservation and offshore wind energy production are difficult to evaluate. Here, we used automated radio-telemetry to track 50 km continuous offshore movements of two Nathusius' pipistrelles (Pipistrellus nathusii) within the Motus network. After crossing the marine waterbody, tagged bats traveled over several hundred kilometers along the coastline from Germany towards the Netherlands and Belgium. Our study highlights the possibility for migratory bats to collide with offshore and coastal wind turbines. Therefore, we plead for implementing pre- and post-construction surveys and adequate mitigation schemes at offshore wind turbines in sensitive areas of the North and Baltic Sea if not already practised.",1,1
Localization of 3D Wireless Sensor Networks Using Improved Bat Algorithm,"Node localization is one of the key technologies of wireless sensor networks, while 3D localization has been becoming a hotspot in the field of localization technology research these years. The paper proposes to transfer the 3D localization problem in WSN into global optimization one and use improved bat algorithm (IBA) for the position estimation of unknown node. For the disadvantages of bat algorithm including premature convergence and slow convergence, an IBA algorithm is proposed. The equation of velocities and positions is modified by inertia weight factor and Levy flight strategy, effectively avoiding trapping in local optimum, accelerating the convergence speed, and realizing the balance of exploration and exploitation capabilities. The experiments on Zigbee platform indicated that IBA boasts higher localization accuracy in 3D space and faster convergence.",0,0
"Ecological drivers of selection for remnant forest habitats by an insectivorous bat in a tropical, human-modified landscape","Biodiversity conservation outside protected areas reduces the impacts of anthropogenic activity and improves the benefits of ecosystem services. However, conservation also requires identification and preservation of habitats used by organisms in human-modified landscapes. Since such landscapes are heterogeneous, with fragmented habitats, space use decisions of species are expected to be non-random and dependent on resource distribution. We examined habitat selection by an insectivorous bat, Megaderma spasma in a human-modified landscape, and tested whether insect resources in the habitat drive its selection. Using high-resolution satellite imagery, we classified a 36 km2 area of a biodiversity hotspot in Western Ghats, India, into three major habitat categories: forest, plantation, and open habitat. We then tracked 18 bats across an average of 7.33 +/- 3 days using radio telemetry and sampled insect resources in forests and plantations. Compositional analysis suggested that Megaderma spasma showed selection for forest habitats. Mixed-effects conditional logistic regression showed that the odds of bats using forest habitats was on average 5.87 times higher than open habitats. Apportionment analysis of insects trapped in forests and plantations showed that habitat type contributed only 0.4% of the difference in diversity at the insect order level, suggesting that insect resources did not differ between the two habitats. However, the relative abundance of one of the bat's prey (katydids of the genus Mecopoda) was significantly higher in forest habitats than in plantations, suggesting that prey abundance in forests may drive the bat's habitat selection. Remnant forest habitats are important resources for insectivorous bats and need to be preserved for maintaining ecosystem functions in human-modified landscapes.",1,1
Post-release survival of hand-reared pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus spp),"There is very little known about the post-release survival of hand-reared pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus spp). We radio-tracked 12 pipistrelle bats, hand-reared and released under three different protocols: i) limited pre-release flight training and over wintering (n = 5); ii) prolonged pre-release flight training, but with limited space (n = 2) and iii) prolonged pre-release flight training in large flight cage (n = 5). Of the five bats reared under the first protocol, four were recovered, grounded, within 48 h and the signal from the fifth bat lost on day two, due either to tag failure or from the bat flying out of the study area. Both bats in the second group flew strongly on the night of release but on the second and third nights only one emerged and flew briefly. The signals from both bats remained stationary on subsequent nights. In contrast, bats from the third group were tracked for between five and ten nights, indicating that they were able to survive independently following release. These preliminary results suggest that post-release survival depends on extensive pre-release conditioning in a large flight cage, rather than the limited flight opportunities traditionally provided within domestic houses by bat carers. Other factors that may affect post-release survival are discussed and further work is encouraged to determine whether rehabilitated bats integrate with the local population.",1,1
Optimum deployment of sensor nodes in wireless sensor network using hybrid fruit fly optimization algorithm and bat optimization algorithm for 3D Environment,"Deployment of sensor nodes in three dimensional areas with sufficient coverage of sensor nodes is one of the major challenges in wireless sensor network. Coverage is main concern in node deployment because it influences the performance of wireless sensor network. For better performance of wireless sensor network it is essential to increase the coverage of nodes by locating the nodes at optimum positions with help of efficient optimization algorithm. In this paper the sensor nodes are located by using Hybrid fruit fly optimization algorithm and bat optimization algorithm in three dimensional environment. The exploration feature of fruit fly optimization algorithm is combined with exploitation characteristics of bat optimization algorithm in proposed algorithm. The grid points covered once by sensor node are removed from entire grid points for remaining nodes. With removal of grid points the overload on sensor nodes is reduced in proposed algorithm. The simulation results of Hybrid fruit fly optimization algorithm and bat optimization algorithm are compared in terms of variance, standard deviation, coverage rate and coefficient of dispersion with fruit fly optimization algorithm and bat optimization algorithm. Moreover, to verify the efficiency of proposed algorithm the results are also compared with other optimization algorithms such as artificial bee colony algorithm with dynamic search strategy, grey wolf optimization algorithm, enhanced grey wolf optimization algorithm, whale optimization algorithm, hybrid shuffled frog leaping algorithm and whale optimization algorithm, differential evolution algorithm, shuffled frog leaping algorithm, hybrid shuffled frog leaping algorithm and whale optimization algorithm based on differential evolution respectively. The simulation result signifies that proposed Hybrid fruit fly optimization algorithm and bat optimization algorithm is efficient than above stated existing optimization algorithm in terms of average coverage rate. The simulation results also demonstrate that proposed algorithm has attained maximum coverage about 99.25% which is higher as compared to existing algorithms. The standard deviation of proposed algorithm is least i.e. 0.0012 which means proposed algorithm is more reliable as compared to existing algorithms for deploying sensor nodes in three dimensional wireless sensor network.",0,0
Activity patterns and roosting of the eastern blossom-bat (Syconycteris australis),"We quantified activity patterns, foraging times and roost selection in the eastern blossom-bat (Syconycteris australis) (body mass 17.6g) in coastal northern New South Wales in winter using radio-telemetry. Bats roosted either in rainforest near their foraging site of flowering coast banksia (Banksia integrifolia) and commuted only 0.3 +/- 0.1km (n=8), whereas others roosted 2.0 +/- 0.2km (n=4) away in wet sclerophyll forest. Most bats roosted in rainforest foliage, but in the wet sclerophyll forest cabbage palm leaves (Livistonia australis) were preferred roosts, which likely reflects behavioural thermoregulation by bats. Foraging commenced 44 +/- 22min after sunset in rainforest-roosting bats, whereas bats that roosted further away and likely flew over canopies/open ground to reach their foraging site left later, especially a female roosting with her likely young (similar to 4h after sunset). Bats returned to their roosts 64 +/- 12min before sunrise. Our study shows that S. australis is capable of commuting considerable distances between appropriate roost and foraging sites when nectar is abundant. Bats appear to vary foraging times appropriately to minimise exposure to predators and to undertake parental care.",1,1
Radar-based Detection of Bats: Experiments in a Laboratory Flight Tunnel,"A high number of bats are being killed by wind energy plants (WEPs) either by direct collision with the rotor-blades or due to an abrupt drop in pressure behind the rotor blades, which leads to the rupture of blood vessels and lungs, and thus to death by internal bleeding (barotrauma). In order to prevent a high bat mortality related to WEPs, a radar sensor seems to be attractive, because bat detection can be realized at long distances and with a high sensitivity. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the detectability of bats using a 24 GHz Doppler Radar sensor in a laboratory flight tunnel. Therefore, the experimental setup as well as the radar sensor and the measurement results will be presented.",0,0
Landscape composition and life-history traits influence bat movement and space use: Analysis of 30 years of published telemetry data,"Aim Animal movement determines home range patterns, which in turn affect individual fitness, population dynamics and ecosystem functioning. Using temperate bats, a group of particular conservation concern, we investigated how morphological traits, habitat specialization and environmental variables affect home range sizes and daily foraging movements, using a compilation of 30 years of published bat telemetry data. Location Northern America and Europe. Time period 1988-2016. Major taxa studied Bats. Methods We compiled data on home range size and mean daily distance between roosts and foraging areas at both colony and individual levels from 166 studies of 3,129 radiotracked individuals of 49 bat species. We calculated multi-scale habitat composition and configuration in the surrounding landscapes of the 165 studied roosts. Using mixed models, we examined the effects of habitat availability and spatial arrangement on bat movements, while accounting for body mass, aspect ratio, wing loading and habitat specialization. Results We found a significant effect of landscape composition on home range size and mean daily distance at both colony and individual levels. On average, home ranges were up to 42% smaller in the most habitat-diversified landscapes while mean daily distances were up to 30% shorter in the most forested landscapes. Bat home range size significantly increased with body mass, wing aspect ratio and wing loading, and decreased with habitat specialization. Main conclusions Promoting bat movements through the landscape surrounding roosts at large spatial scales is crucial for bat conservation. Forest loss and overall landscape homogenization lead temperate bats to fly further to meet their ecological requirements, by increasing home range sizes and daily foraging distances. Both processes might be more detrimental for smaller, habitat-specialized bats, less able to travel increasingly longer distances to meet their diverse needs.",0,0
A Power Consumption Balancing Algorithm Based on Evolved Bat Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Network,"It is known that sensor nodes equipped with limited battery power in wireless sensor network, the sensor network will paralyze if sensor node run out of its energy. Therefore energy awareness is an essential consideration for wireless sensor network. Recent advances in wireless sensor networks have led to many new protocols specifically for saving sensor node's energy. A new scheme for predetermining the optimized routing path is proposed based on the evolved bat algorithm (EBA) in this paper. This is the first leading precedent that the EBA is employed to provide the routing scheme for the WSN. A simulation is given and the results obtained by the EBA are compared with the AODV, the LD method based on ACO. The simulation results indicate that our proposed method shows good performance on average power consumption.",1,0
"Relations between topography, feeding sites, and foraging behavior of the vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus","The vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) plays a crucial role in the maintenance and transmission of the rabies virus to humans and livestock, impacting public health and economic production. Its importance lies not only in its capacity to transmit the virus but also in its ability to adapt to anthropic changes, as expressed in its wide geographic distribution in Latin America. Deforestation, livestock intensification, and other human activities have reduced the abundance of its wild prey but have also provided new and abundant shelter and foraging resources for the vampire bats. We used radiotelemetry to evaluate relations between topography, feeding site choice, and foraging behavior in southeastern Brazil, where three occupied D. rotundus roosts, out of 11 possible, were systematically monitored throughout a 1-year period once every 2 months. Sixty-two vampire bats were captured; biometric data were collected and 44 radiotransmitters were installed in adult individuals, producing telemetry data that were recorded in VHF receptors installed in the farms. Elevation of the roosts was related to the farms attacked by the vampire bats. Understanding the use of the environment and resources by vampire bats is critical to improving rabies control aiming at the reduction of disease impacts. From the perspective of the official veterinary service, telemetry would be ineffective as a rabies surveillance system due to the costs and limitations of the available technology. However, livestock rabies control measures would be greatly improved if ecological characteristics of the vampire bat were considered.",1,1
The Motus Wildlife Tracking System: a collaborative research network to enhance the understanding of wildlife movement,"We describe a new collaborative network, the Motus Wildlife Tracking System (Motus; https://motus.org), which is an international network of researchers using coordinated automated radio-telemetry arrays to study movements of small flying organisms including birds, bats, and insects, at local, regional, and hemispheric scales. Radio-telemetry has been a cornerstone of tracking studies for over 50 years, and because of current limitations of geographic positioning systems (GPS) and satellite transmitters, has remained the primary means to track movements of small animals with high temporal and spatial precision. Automated receivers, along with recent miniaturization and digital coding of tags, have further improved the utility of radio-telemetry by allowing many individuals to be tracked continuously and simultaneously across broad landscapes. Motus is novel among automated arrays in that collaborators employ a single radio frequency across receiving stations over a broad geographic scale, allowing individuals to be detected at sites maintained by others. Motus also coordinates, disseminates, and archives detections and associated metadata in a central repository. Combined with the ability to track many individuals simultaneously, Motus has expanded the scope and spatial scale of research questions that can be addressed using radio-telemetry from local to regional and even hemispheric scales. Since its inception in 2012, more than 9000 individuals of over 87 species of birds, bats, and insects have been tracked, resulting in more than 250 million detections. This rich and comprehensive dataset includes detections of individuals during all phases of the annual cycle (breeding, migration, and nonbreeding), and at a variety of spatial scales, resulting in novel insights into the movement behavior of small flying animals. The value of the Motus network will grow as spatial coverage of stations and number of partners and collaborators increases. With continued expansion and support, Motus can provide a framework for global collaboration, and a coordinated approach to solving some of the most complex problems in movement biology and ecology.",1,1
Some like it cold: summer torpor by freetail bats in the Australian arid zone,"Bats are among the most successful groups of Australian arid-zone mammals and, therefore, must cope with pronounced seasonal fluctuations in ambient temperature (T (a)), food availability and unpredictable weather patterns. As knowledge about the energy conserving strategies in desert bats is scant, we used temperature-telemetry to quantify the thermal physiology of tree-roosting inland freetail bats (Mormopterus species 3, 8.5 g, n = 8) at Sturt National Park over two summers (2010-2012), when T (a) was high and insects were relatively abundant. Torpor use and activity were affected by T (a). Bats remained normothermic on the warmest days; they employed one morning torpor bout on most days and typically exhibited two torpor bouts on the coolest days. Overall, animals employed torpor on 67.9 % of bat-days and torpor bout duration ranged from 0.5 to 39.3 h. At any given T (a), torpor bouts were longer in Mormopterus than in bats from temperate and subtropical habitats. Furthermore, unlike bats from other climatic regions that used only partial passive rewarming, Mormopterus aroused from torpor using either almost entirely passive (68.9 % of all arousals) or active rewarming (31.1 %). We provide the first quantitative data on torpor in a free-ranging arid-zone molossid during summer. They demonstrate that this desert bat uses torpor extensively in summer and often rewarms passively from torpor to maximise energy and water conservation.",1,1
Automated proximity sensing in small vertebrates: design of miniaturized sensor nodes and first field tests in bats,"Social evolution has led to a stunning diversity of complex social behavior, in particular in vertebrate taxa. Thorough documentation of social interactions is crucial to study the causes and consequences of sociality in gregarious animals. Wireless digital transceivers represent a promising tool to revolutionize data collection for the study of social interactions in terms of the degree of automation, data quantity, and quality. Unfortunately, devices for automated proximity sensing via direct communication among animal-borne sensors are usually heavy and do not allow for the investigation of small animal species, which represent the majority of avian and mammalian taxa. We present a lightweight animal-borne sensor node that is built from commercially available components and uses a sophisticated scheme for energy-efficient communication, with high sampling rates at relatively low power consumption. We demonstrate the basic functionality of the sensor node under laboratory conditions and its applicability for the study of social interactions among free-ranging animals. The first field tests were performed on two species of bats in temperate and tropical ecosystems. At <2g, this sensor node is light enough to observe a broad spectrum of taxa including small vertebrates. Given our specifications, the system was especially sensitive to changes in distance within the short range (up to a distance of 4m between tags). High spatial resolution at short distances enables the evaluation of interactions among individuals at a fine scale and the investigation of close contacts. This technology opens new avenues of research, allowing detailed investigation of events associated with social contact, such as mating behavior, pathogen transmission, social learning, and resource sharing. Social behavior that is not easily observed becomes observable, for example, in animals living in burrows or in nocturnal animals. A switch from traditional methods to the application of digital transceiver chips in proximity sensing offers numerous advantages in addition to an enormous increase in data quality and quantity. For future applications, the platform allows for the integration of additional sensors that may collect physiological or environmental data. Such information complements social network studies and may allow for a deeper understanding of animal ecology and social behavior.",1,1
